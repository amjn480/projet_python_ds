1981, in houston, texas, to celestine "tina" knowles (née beyonce), a hairdresser and salon owner, and mathew knowles, a xerox sales manager. tina is louisiana creole, and mathew is african american. beyoncé's younger sister, solange knowles, is also a singer and a former backup dancer for destiny's child. solange and beyoncé are the first sisters to have both had number one solo albums.beyoncé's maternal grandparents, lumas beyince, and agnez dereon (daughter of odilia broussard and eugene derouen), were french-speaking louisiana creoles, with roots in new iberia. beyoncé is considered a creole, passed on to her by her grandparents. she is a descendant of acadian militia officer joseph broussard, who was exiled to french louisiana after the expulsion of the acadians.her fourth great-grandmother, marie-françoise trahan, was born in 1774 in bangor, located on belle île, france. trahan was a daughter of acadians who had taken refuge on belle île after the acadian expulsion. the estates of brittany had divided the lands of belle île to distribute them among 78 other acadian families and the already settled inhabitants. the trahan family lived on belle île for over ten years before immigrating to louisiana, where she married a broussard descendant. beyoncé researched her ancestry and discovered that she is descended from a slave owner who married his slave. her mother is also of distant irish, jewish, spanish, chinese and indonesian ancestry.beyoncé was raised methodist and attended st. john's united methodist church. she went to st. mary's montessori school in houston, and enrolled in dance classes there. her singing was discovered when dance instructor darlette johnson began humming a song and she finished it, able to hit the high-pitched notes.

beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. in 1995, beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. the move reduced the family's income by half, and beyoncé's parents were forced to sell their house and cars and move into separated apartments.mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established r&b girl groups. the girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to elektra records, moving to atlanta records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. this

most-awarded female artist, and second-most-awarded artist in grammy history.in 2021, beyoncé wrote and recorded a song titled "be alive" for the biographical drama film king richard. she received her first academy award nomination for best original song at the 94th academy awards for the song, alongside co-writer dixson. 2022–present: renaissance on june 9, 2022, beyoncé removed her profile pictures across various social media platforms causing speculation that she would be releasing new music. days later, beyoncé caused further speculation via her nonprofit beygood's twitter account hinting at her upcoming seventh studio album. on june 15, 2022, beyoncé officially announced her seventh studio album, titled renaissance. the album was released on july 29, 2022. the first single from renaissance, "break my soul", was released on june 20, 2022. the song became beyoncé's 20th top ten single on the billboard hot 100, and in doing so, beyoncé joined paul mccartney and michael jackson as the only artists in hot 100 history to achieve at least twenty top tens as a solo artist and ten as a member of a group.upon release, renaissance received universal acclaim from critics. renaissance debuted at number one on the billboard 200 chart, and in doing so, beyoncé became the first female artist to have her first seven studio albums debut at number one in the united states. "break my soul" concurrently rose to number 1 on the billboard hot 100, becoming the twelfth song to do so across her career discography.the song "heated," which was co-written with canadian rapper drake, originally included the lyrics "spazzin' on that ass / spazz on that ass". critics, including a number of disability charities and activists, argued that the word "spaz" represented a derogatory term for spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy. in response, in august 2022, a representative for beyoncé issued a statement and explained that "the word, not used intentionally in a harmful way, will be replaced".on january 21, 2023, beyoncé performed in dubai at a private show. the performance, which was her first full concert in more than four years, was delivered to an audience of influencers and journalists. beyoncé was reportedly paid $24 million to perform. beyoncé faced criticism for her decision to perform in the united arab emirates where homosexuality is illegal. on february 1, beyoncé announced the renaissance world tour with dates in north america and europe, becoming for a short-span the highest-grossing tour by a female artist. on july 28, beyoncé appeared on "delresto (echoes)", the second single from rapper travis scott's album utopia, eventually becoming her 100th career appearance on the billboard hot 100 chart (encompassing destiny's child, her solo career, and musical duo the carters). artistry  voice and musical style critics have described beyoncé's voice as being mezzo-soprano. jody rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as "one of the most compelling instruments in popular music". her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of destiny's child. jon pareles of the new york times commented that her voice is "velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting". rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced beyoncé's unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto.other critics praise her range and power, with chris richards of the washington post saying she was "capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars." on the 2023 rolling stone's list of the 200 greatest singers of all time, beyoncé ranked at number 8, with the publication noting that "in [her] voice lies the entire history of black music".beyoncé's music is generally r&b, pop and hip hop but she also incorporates soul and funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated beyoncé's exploration of 1990s-style r&b, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases. while she almost exclusively releases english songs, beyoncé recorded several spanish songs for irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from b'day for a spanish-language audience), and the re-release of b'day. to record these, beyoncé was coached phonetically by american record producer rudy perez. songwriting beyoncé has received co-writing credits for most of her songs. in regards to the way she approaches collaborative songwriting, beyoncé explained: "i love being around great writers because i'm finding that a lot of the things i want to say, i don't articulate as good as maybe amanda ghost, so i want to keep collaborating with writers, and i love classics and i want to make sure years from now the song is still something that's relevant." her early songs with destiny's child were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like "independent women" and "survivor", but after the start of her relationship with jay-z, she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as "cater 2 u".beyoncé's songwriting process is also notorious for combining parts of different tracks, resulting in alteration of song structures. sia, who co-wrote "pretty hurts", called beyoncé "very frankenstein when she comes to songs"; diana gordon, who co-wrote "don't hurt yourself" called her a "scientist of songs"; caroline polachek who co-wrote "no angel", called her a "genius writer and producer for this reason. she's so good at seeing connections."in 2001, she became the first black woman and second female lyricist to win the pop songwriter of the year award at the ascap pop music awards. beyoncé was the third woman to have writing credits on three number-one songs ("irreplaceable", "grillz" and "check on it") in the same year, after carole king in 1971 and mariah carey in 1991. she is tied with american lyricist diane warren at third with nine songwriting credits on number-one singles. the latter wrote her 9/11-motivated song "i was here" for 4. in may 2011, billboard magazine listed beyoncé at number 17 on their list of the top 20 hot 100 songwriters for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the billboard hot 100 chart. she was one of only three women on that list, along with alicia keys and taylor swift.beyoncé has received criticism, including from journalists and musicians, for the extensive writing credits on her songs. the controversy surrounding her songwriting credits began with interviews in which she attributed herself as the songwriter for songs in which she was a co-writer or for which her contributions were marginal. in a cover story for vanity fair in 2005, she claimed to have "written" several number-one songs for destiny's child, contrary to the credits, which list her as a co-writer among others. during a 2007 interview with barbara walters, she claimed to have conceived the musical idea for the destiny's child song "bootylicious", which provoked the song's producer rob fusari to call her father and then-manager mathew knowles in protest over the claim. in 2010, fusari told billboard: "[knowles] explained to me, in a nice way, he said, 'people don't want to hear about rob fusari, producer from livingston, n.j. no offense, but that's not what sells records. what sells records is people believing that the artist is everything.'" however, in an interview for entertainment weekly in 2016, fusari said beyoncé "had the 'bootylicious' concept in her head. that was totally her. she knew what she wanted to say. it was very urban pop angle that they were taking on the record." influences beyoncé names michael jackson as her major musical influence. aged five, beyoncé attended her first ever concert where jackson performed and she claims to have realized her purpose. when she presented him with a tribute award at the world music awards in 2006, beyoncé said, "if it wasn't for michael jackson, i would never ever have performed." beyoncé was heavily influenced by tina turner, and once said "tina turner is someone that i admire, because she made her strength feminine and sexy".she admires diana ross as an "all-around entertainer", and whitney houston, who she said "inspired me to get up there and do what she did." beyoncé cited madonna as an influence "not only for her musical style, but also for her business sense", saying that she wanted to "follow in the footsteps of madonna and be a powerhouse and have my own empire." she also credits mariah carey's singing and her song "vision of love" as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child. her other musical influences include rachelle ferrell, aaliyah, janet jackson, prince, shakira, lauryn hill, sade adu, donna summer, mary j. blige, selena,    anita baker, and toni braxton.the feminism and female empowerment themes on beyoncé's second solo album b'day were inspired by her role in dreamgirls and by singer josephine baker. beyoncé paid homage to baker by performing "déjà vu" at the 2006 fashion rocks concert wearing baker's trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas. beyoncé's third solo album, i am... sasha fierce, was inspired by jay-z and especially by etta james, whose "boldness" inspired beyoncé to explore other musical genres and styles. her fourth solo album, 4, was inspired by fela kuti, 1990s r&b, earth, wind & fire, debarge, lionel richie, teena marie, the jackson 5, new edition, adele, florence and the machine, and prince.beyoncé has stated that she is personally inspired by michelle obama (the 44th first lady of the united states), saying "she proves you can do it all", and has described oprah winfrey as "the definition of inspiration and a strong woman." she has also discussed how jay-z is a continuing inspiration to her, both with what she describes as his lyrical genius and in the obstacles he has overcome in his life. beyoncé has expressed admiration for the artist jean-michel basquiat, posting in a letter "what i find in the work of jean-michel basquiat, i search for in every day in music ... he is lyrical and raw". beyoncé also cited cher as a fashion inspiration. music videos and stage in 2006, beyoncé introduced her all-female tour band suga mama (also the name of a song on b'day) which includes bassists, drummers, guitarists, horn players, keyboardists and percussionists. her background singers, the mamas, consist of montina cooper-donnell, crystal collins and tiffany moniqué riddick. they made their debut appearance at the 2006 bet awards and re-appeared in the music videos for "irreplaceable" and "green light". the band have supported beyoncé in most subsequent live performances, including her 2007 concert tour the beyoncé experience, i am... tour (2009–2010), the mrs. carter show world tour (2013–2014) and the formation world tour (2016).beyoncé has received praise for her stage presence and voice during live performances. according to barbara ellen of the guardian, beyoncé is the most in-charge female artist she's seen onstage. similarly, alice jones of the independent wrote she "takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good." the ex-president of def jam l.a. reid has described beyoncé as the greatest entertainer alive. jim farber of the daily news and stephanie classen of the starphoenix both praised her strong voice and her stage presence. beyoncé's stage outfits have been met with criticism from many countries, such as malaysia, where she has postponed or cancelled performances due to the country's strict laws banning revealing costumes.beyoncé has worked with numerous directors for her music videos throughout her career, including melina matsoukas, jonas åkerlund, and jake nava. bill condon, director of beauty and the beast, stated that the lemonade visuals in particular served as inspiration for his film, commenting, "you look at beyoncé's brilliant movie lemonade, this genre is taking on so many different forms ... i do think that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want." alter ego described as being "sexy, seductive and provocative" when performing on stage, beyoncé has said that she originally created the alter ego "sasha fierce" to keep that stage persona separate from who she really is. she described sasha as being "too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy", stating, "i'm not like her in real life at all." sasha was conceived during the making of "crazy in love", and beyoncé introduced her with the release of her 2008 album, i am... sasha fierce. in february 2010, she announced in an interview with allure magazine that she was comfortable enough with herself to no longer need sasha fierce. however, beyoncé announced in may 2012 that she would bring her back for her revel presents: beyoncé live shows later that month. public image beyoncé has been described as having a wide-ranging sex appeal, with music journalist touré writing that since the release of dangerously in love, she has "become a crossover sex symbol". offstage beyoncé says that while she likes to dress sexily, her onstage dress "is absolutely for the stage". due to her curves and the term's catchiness, in the 2000s, the media often used the term "bootylicious" (a portmanteau of the words "booty" and "delicious") to describe beyoncé, the term popularized by destiny's child's single of the same name. in 2006, it was added to the oxford english dictionary.in september 2010, beyoncé made her runway modelling debut at tom ford's spring/summer 2011 fashion show. she was named the "world's most beautiful woman" by people and the "hottest female singer of all time" by complex in 2012. in january 2013, gq placed her on its cover, featuring her atop its "100 sexiest women of the 21st century" list. vh1 listed her at number 1 on its 100 sexiest artists list. several wax figures of beyoncé are found at madame tussauds wax museums in major cities around the world, including new york, washington, d.c., amsterdam, bangkok, hollywood and sydney.according to italian fashion designer roberto cavalli, beyoncé uses different fashion styles to work with her music while performing. her mother co-wrote a book, published in 2002, titled destiny's style, an account of how fashion affected the trio's success. the b'day anthology video album showed many instances of fashion-oriented footage, depicting classic to contemporary wardrobe styles. in 2007, beyoncé was featured on the cover of the sports illustrated swimsuit issue, becoming the second african american woman after tyra banks, and people magazine recognized beyoncé as the best-dressed celebrity.beyoncé has been named "queen bey" from publications over the years. the term is a reference to the common phrase "queen bee", a term used for the leader of a group of females. the nickname also refers to the queen of a beehive, with her fan base being named "the beyhive". the beyhive was previously titled "the beyontourage", (a portmanteau of beyoncé and entourage), but was changed after online petitions on twitter and online news reports during competitions.in 2006, the animal rights organization people for the ethical treatment of animals (peta), criticized beyoncé for wearing and using fur in her clothing line house of deréon.emmett price, a professor of music at northeastern university, wrote in 2007 that he thinks race plays a role in many criticisms of beyoncé's image, saying white celebrities who dress similarly do not attract as many comments. in 2008, l'oréal was accused of whitening her skin in their feria hair color advertisements, responding that "it is categorically untrue", and in 2013, beyoncé herself criticized h&m for their proposed "retouching" of promotional images of her, and according to vogue requested that only "natural pictures be used".beyoncé has been a vocal advocate for the black lives matter movement. the release of "formation" on february 6, 2016, saw her celebrate her heritage, with the song's music video featuring pro-black imagery and a shot of wall graffiti that says "stop shooting us". the day after the song's release she performed it at the 2016 super bowl halftime show with back up dancers dressed to represent the black panther party. this incited criticism from politicians and police officers, with some police boycotting beyoncé's then upcoming formation world tour. beyoncé responded to the backlash by releasing tour merchandise that said "boycott beyoncé", and later clarified her sentiment, saying: "anyone who perceives my message as anti-police is completely mistaken. i have so much admiration and respect for officers and the families of officers who sacrifice themselves to keep us safe," beyoncé said. "but let's be clear: i am against police brutality and injustice. those are two separate things." personal life  marriage and children in 2002, beyoncé and jay-z collaborated on the song "'03 bonnie & clyde", which appeared on his seventh album the blueprint 2: the gift & the curse (2002). beyoncé appeared as jay-z's girlfriend in the music video for the song, fueling speculation about their relationship. on april 4, 2008, beyoncé and jay-z married without publicity. as of april 2014, the couple had sold a combined 300 million records together. they are known for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed since 2013. both have acknowledged difficulty that arose in their marriage after jay-z had an affair.beyoncé miscarried around 2010 or 2011, describing it as "the saddest thing" she had ever endured. she returned to the studio and wrote music to cope with the loss. in april 2011, beyoncé and jay-z traveled to paris to shoot the album cover for 4, and she unexpectedly became pregnant in paris. in august, the couple attended the 2011 mtv video music awards, at which beyoncé performed "love on top" and ended the performance by revealing she was pregnant. her appearance helped that year's mtv video music awards become the most-watched broadcast in mtv history, pulling in 12.4 million viewers; the announcement was listed in guinness world records for "most tweets per second recorded for a single event" on twitter, receiving 8,868 tweets per second and "beyonce pregnant" was the most googled phrase the week of august 29, 2011. on january 7, 2012, beyoncé gave birth to a daughter, blue ivy, at lenox hill hospital in new york city.following the release of lemonade, which included the single "sorry", in 2016, speculations arose about jay-z's alleged infidelity with a mistress referred to as "becky". jon pareles in the new york times pointed out that many of the accusations were "aimed specifically and recognizably" at him. similarly, rob sheffield of rolling stone magazine noted the lines "suck on my balls, i've had enough" were an "unmistakable hint" that the lyrics revolve around jay-z.on february 1, 2017, she revealed on her instagram account that she was expecting twins. her announcement gained over 6.3 million likes within eight hours, breaking the world record for the most liked image on the website at the time. on july 13, 2017, beyoncé uploaded the first image of herself and the twins onto her instagram account, confirming their birth date as a month prior, on june 13, 2017, with the post becoming the second most liked on instagram, behind her own pregnancy announcement. the twins, a daughter named rumi and a son named sir, were born at ronald reagan ucla medical center in california. she wrote of her pregnancy and its aftermath in the september 2018 issue of vogue, in which she had full control of the cover, shot at hammerwood park by photographer tyler mitchell. activism beyoncé performed "america the beautiful" at president barack obama's 2009 presidential inauguration, as well as "at last" during the first inaugural dance at the neighborhood ball two days later. the couple held a fundraiser at jay-z's 40/40 club in manhattan for president obama's 2012 presidential campaign which raised $4 million. beyoncé voted for obama in the 2012 presidential election. she performed the american national anthem "the star-spangled banner" at his second inauguration in january 2013.the washington post reported in may 2015, that beyoncé attended a major celebrity fundraiser for 2016 presidential nominee hillary clinton. she also headlined for clinton in a concert held the weekend before election day the next year. in this performance, beyoncé and her entourage of backup dancers wore pantsuits; a clear allusion to clinton's frequent dress-of-choice. the backup dancers also wore "i'm with her" tee shirts, the campaign slogan for clinton. in a brief speech at this performance beyoncé said, "i want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and knowing that her possibilities are limitless." she endorsed the bid of beto o'rourke during the 2018 united states senate election in texas.in 2013, beyoncé stated in an interview in vogue that she considered herself to be "a modern-day feminist". she would later align herself more publicly with the movement, sampling "we should all be feminists", a speech delivered by nigerian author chimamanda ngozi adichie at a tedx talk in april 2013, in her song "flawless", released later that year. the next year she performed live at the mtv video awards in front a giant backdrop reading "feminist". her self-identification incited a circulation of opinions and debate about whether her feminism is aligned with older, more established feminist ideals. annie lennox, celebrated artist and feminist advocate, referred to beyoncé's use of her word feminist as 'feminist lite'.bell hooks critiqued beyoncé, referring to her as a "terrorist" towards feminism, harmfully impacting her audience of young girls. adichie responded with "her type of feminism is not mine, as it is the kind that, at the same time, gives quite a lot of space to the necessity of men." adichie expands upon what "feminist lite" means to her, referring that "more troubling is the idea, in feminism lite, that men are naturally superior but should be expected to 'treat women well'" and "we judge powerful women more harshly than we judge powerful men. and feminism lite enables this."beyoncé responded about her intent by utilizing the definition of feminist with her platform was to "give clarity to the true meaning" behind it. she says to understand what being a feminist is, "it's very simple. it's someone who believes in equal rights for men and women." she advocated to provide equal opportunities for young boys and girls, men and women must begin to understand the double standards that remain persistent in our societies and the issue must be illuminated in effort to start making changes.she has also contributed to the ban bossy campaign, which uses tv and social media to encourage leadership in girls. following beyoncé's public identification as a feminist, the sexualized nature of her performances and the fact that she championed her marriage was questioned.in december 2012, beyoncé along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for "demand a plan", a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 u.s. mayors and others designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws, following the sandy hook elementary school shooting. beyoncé publicly endorsed same-sex marriage on march 26, 2013, after the supreme court debate on california's proposition 8. she spoke against north carolina's public facilities privacy & security act, a bill passed (and later repealed) that discriminated against the lgbt community in public places in a statement during her concert in raleigh as part of the formation world tour in 2016.she has condemned police brutality against black americans. she and jay-z attended a rally in 2013 in response to the acquittal of george zimmerman for the killing of trayvon martin. the film for her sixth album lemonade included the mothers of trayvon martin, michael brown and eric garner, holding pictures of their sons in the video for "freedom". in a 2016 interview with elle, beyoncé responded to the controversy surrounding her song "formation" which was perceived to be critical of the police. she clarified, "i am against police brutality and injustice. those are two separate things. if celebrating my roots and culture during black history month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me".in february 2017, beyoncé spoke out against the withdrawal of protections for transgender students in public schools by donald trump's presidential administration. posting a link to the 100 days of kindness campaign on her facebook page, beyoncé voiced her support for transgender youth and joined a roster of celebrities who spoke out against trump's decision.in november 2017, beyoncé presented colin kaepernick with the 2017 sports illustrated muhammad ali legacy award, stating, "thank you for your selfless heart and your conviction, thank you for your personal sacrifice", and that "colin took action with no fear of consequence ... to change perception, to change the way we treat each other, especially people of color. we're still waiting for the world to catch up." muhammad ali was heavily penalized in his career for protesting the status quo of us civil rights through opposition to the vietnam war, by refusing to serve in the military. 40 years later, kaepernick had already lost one professional year due to taking a much quieter and legal stand "for people that are oppressed". wealth forbes magazine began reporting on beyoncé's earnings in 2008, calculating that the $80 million earned between june 2007 to june 2008, for her music, tour, films and clothing line made her the world's best-paid music personality at the time, above madonna and celine dion. it placed her fourth on the celebrity 100 list in 2009 and ninth on the "most powerful women in the world" list in 2010. the following year, the magazine placed her eighth on the "best-paid celebrities under 30" list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. in 2012, forbes placed beyoncé at number 16 on the celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals.in 2012, beyoncé and jay-z placed at number one on the "world's highest-paid celebrity couples", for collectively earning $78 million. the couple made it into the previous year's guinness world records as the "highest-earning power couple" for collectively earning $122 million in 2009. for the years 2009 to 2011, beyoncé earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012. in 2013, beyoncé's endorsements of pepsi and h&m made her and jay-z the world's first billion dollar couple in the music industry. that year, beyoncé was published as the fourth most-powerful celebrity in the forbes rankings.in april 2014, billboard named her the highest-earning black musician in history. in june 2014, beyoncé ranked at number one on the forbes celebrity 100 list, earning an estimated $115 million throughout june 2013 – june 2014. this in turn was the first time she had topped the celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly earnings to date. in 2016, beyoncé ranked at number 34 on the celebrity 100 list with earnings of $54 million. she and jay-z also topped the highest paid celebrity couple list, with combined earnings of $107.5 million.as of 2018, forbes calculated her net worth to be $355 million, and in june of the same year, ranked her as the 35th highest earning celebrity with annual earnings of $60 million. this tied beyoncé with madonna as the only two female artists to earn more than $100 million within a single year twice. as a couple, beyoncé and jay-z have a combined net worth of $1.16 billion. in july 2017, billboard announced that beyoncé was the highest paid musician of 2016, with an estimated total of $62.1 million.in 2023, the couple bought 27712 pacific coast highway, a house in malibu, california, designed by the architect tadao ando, for $200 million. it established a record for the most expensive residence sold in california. legacy beyoncé's success has led to her becoming a cultural icon and earning her the nickname "queen bey". constance grady wrote for vox, "the transformation of beyoncé from well-liked pop star to cultural icon came in three phases, punctuated by the self-titled beyoncé album of 2013, 2016's lemonade, and 2018's homecoming concert at coachella." in the new yorker, music critic jody rosen described beyoncé as "the most important and compelling popular musician of the twenty-first century ... the result, the logical end point, of a century-plus of pop." she topped npr list of the "21st century's most influential women musicians". james clear, in his book atomic habits (2018), draws a parallel between beyoncé's success and the dramatic transformations in modern society: "in the last one hundred years, we have seen the rise of the car, the airplane, the television, the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone, and beyoncé." the observer named her artist of the decade (2000s) in 2009.writing for entertainment weekly, alex suskind noticed how beyoncé was the decade's (2010s) defining pop star, stating that "no one dominated music in the 2010s like queen bey", explaining that her "songs, album rollouts, stage presence, social justice initiatives, and disruptive public relations strategy have influenced the way we've viewed music since 2010." british publication nme also shared similar thoughts on her impact in the 2010s, including beyoncé on their list of the "10 artists who defined the decade". in 2018, rolling stone included her on its millennial 100 list.music critics have often credited beyoncé with the invention of the staccato rap-singing style that has since dominated pop, r&b, and rap music. lakin starling of the fader wrote that beyoncé's innovative implementation of the delivery style on destiny's child's 1999 album the writing's on the wall invented a new form of r&b. beyoncé's new style subsequently changed the nature of music, revolutionizing both singing in urban music and rapping in pop music, and becoming the dominant sound of both genres. the style helped to redefine both the breadth of commercial r&b and the sound of hip hop, with artists such as kanye west and drake implementing beyoncé's cadence in the late 2000s and early 2010s. the staccato rap-singing style continued to be used in the music industry in the late 2010s and early 2020s; aaron williams of uproxx described beyoncé as the "primary pioneer" of the rapping style that dominates the music industry today, with many contemporary rappers implementing beyoncé's rap-singing. michael eric dyson agrees, saying that beyoncé "changed the whole genre" and has become the "godmother" of mumble rappers, who use the staccato rap-singing cadence. dyson added: "she doesn't get credit for the remarkable way in which she changed the musical vocabulary of contemporary art."beyoncé has been credited with reviving the album as an art form in an era dominated by singles and streaming. this started with her 2011 album 4; while mainstream r&b artists were forgoing albums-led r&b in favor of singles-led edm, beyoncé aimed to place the focus back on albums as an art form and re-establish r&b as a mainstream concern. this remained a focus of beyoncé's, and in 2013, she made her eponymous album only available to purchase as a full album on itunes, rather than being able to purchase individual tracks or consume the album via streaming. kaitlin menza of marie claire wrote that this made listeners "experience the album as one whole sonic experience, the way people used to, noting the musical and lyrical themes".jamieson cox for the verge described how beyoncé's 2013 album initiated a gradual trend of albums becoming more cohesive and self-referential, and this phenomenon reached its endpoint with lemonade, which set "a new standard for pop storytelling at the highest possible scale". megan carpentier of the guardian wrote that with lemonade, beyoncé has "almost revived the album format" by releasing an album that can only be listened to in its entirety. myf warhurst on double j's "lunch with myf" explained that while most artists' albums consist of a few singles plus filler songs, beyoncé "brought the album back", changing the art form of the album "to a narrative with an arc and a story and you have to listen to the entire thing to get the concept".she is known for coining popular phrases such as "put a ring on it", a
