==== main films ====

in 2000, actor paul walker had worked with director rob cohen on the skulls. cohen secured a deal with producer neal h. moritz for an untitled action film for universal pictures, and approached walker and asked him to suggest his "dream" action film; walker suggested a mash-up of the films days of thunder (1990) and donnie brasco (1997). soon thereafter, cohen and moritz brought him the vibe magazine article "racer x" by ken li, published in may 1998, which detailed underground street racing operating in new york city, and suggested a story set to follow walker as an undercover cop tasked with infiltrating the world of underground street racing in los angeles inspired by the article. upon hearing this, walker signed on immediately; finding his co-star proved difficult. the studio warmed toward the idea of timothy olyphant in the role of dominic toretto, due to the success of the blockbuster gone in 60 seconds (2000), but he declined. moritz persisted on vin diesel following his performance in pitch black (2000), with diesel accepting after proposing several script changes. moritz had difficulty choosing between the titles racer x (after the article), redline, race wars and street wars, but was ultimately inspired by a documentary on american international pictures, which included the 1954 film the fast and the furious. moritz was traded use of some stock footage to its director, roger corman, in exchange for a license to use the title. upon release in june 2001, the film shattered box office expectations and a sequel was green-lit.diesel declined to return for the sequel, saying that the screenplay was inferior to its predecessor. cohen also declined the sequel, opting to develop the film xxx (2002), which starred diesel in the lead role. to account for these changes, universal commissioned the writers to create a standalone sequel with walker in the lead and brought in john singleton as the new director. filming was delayed by a year and the production location shifted to miami. tyrese gibson, who worked with singleton on the film baby boy (2001), was hired as walker's new co-star and was the first entry in the series to feature long-running cast member ludacris.universal attempted to bring back diesel for the third installment, but he again declined due to other projects and a dislike for the script. after failing to secure the returns of walker or any other member of the original cast, universal ordered a reboot of the franchise. screenwriter chris morgan subsequently attempted to revive the series primarily for car enthusiasts, introducing new characters, focusing on a car-related subculture and moving the series to tokyo; japan contains one of the world's largest automotive industries. it is the first film in the series to start its tradition of filming in locations outside the united states. moritz returned and hired director justin lin, having been impressed with lin's work for the film better luck tomorrow (2002), which shared similar elements with tokyo drift. the third film marked the first appearance in the fast & furious franchise of han lue, portrayed by sung kang, a character who originated from lin's better luck tomorrow. although the relation between better luck tomorrow and fast & furious was originally left unaddressed, both lin and kang repeatedly confirmed during the following years that it was the same character, and that better luck tomorrow doubled as han's origin story, retroactively making the film part of the fast & furious continuity. moreover, with tokyo drift, the series was able to bring diesel in for a cameo appearance, in exchange for letting the actor's production company acquire the rights to the riddick character. the third film was the least financially successful of the franchise, received lukewarm reception and left the future of the franchise in limbo.away from the franchise, diesel made a string of box office or critical flops, including the chronicles of riddick (2004), the pacifier (2005) and find me guilty (2006), but his cameo in tokyo drift generated interest in reviving the series. after signing diesel and confirming the return of lin, universal worked to track the first film's original co-stars and re-signed walker, michelle rodriguez and jordana brewster in mid-2008. walker was initially reluctant to rejoin the franchise after six years, but diesel assured him that film would be considered the first "true" sequel. morgan returned to write after the critical praise for the character han lue. given the apparent death of the character in the third film, the timeline of the franchise was altered to account for his appearance. with the emphasis on car culture toned down, the fourth film, fast & furious, was a commercial success. although critical reception was mixed, it reinvigorated the franchise, as well as the star power of diesel and walker.

in 2011, fast five was released. while developing the film, universal completely departed from any street racing elements prevalent in previous films, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. by doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. fast five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls and the heist. fast five was initially conceived to conclude the franchise, but following positive reception at test screenings, alongside its eventual strong critical and commercial performance, universal proceeded to develop a sixth film. furthermore, the film is noted for the addition of dwayne johnson to the cast, whose performance was critically praised.in late 2011, the los angeles times reported that universal was approaching the sixth and seventh installment with a single storyline running through both films, with morgan envisaging themes of freedom and family, but later shifted to account for the studio's wishes to incorporate elements of espionage. lin revealed that he had, after discussions with diesel, storyboarded, previsualized and began editing a twelve-minute finale for fast & furious 6, before filming was completed on fast five. upon release, the sixth film became the highest-grossing film in the series, grossing $788 million worldwide.universal lacked a major event film for 2014 and rushed furious 7 into pre-production in mid-2013 due to its status as a bankable asset. lin decided not to return to direct the seventh film, as he was still performing post-production on fast & furious 6. james wan, primarily known for horror films, took over directorial duties. on november 30, 2013, walker died in a single-vehicle crash, with filming only half-completed. following walker's death, filming was delayed for script rewrites, and his brothers, caleb and cody, were used as stand-ins to complete his remaining scenes. the script rewrites completed the story arcs of both walker and brewster's characters. visual effects company weta digital was hired to re-create walker's likeness. ultimately, the film's delays saw it being released in april 2015, where it became the highest-grossing film in the franchise, grossing $1.5 billion. it was also the most critically successful, with praise being aimed at the film's action sequences and its emotional tribute to walker.the toll of multiple re-shoots dissuaded wan from returning to the franchise and universal hired f. gary gray to helm the eighth film, the fate of the furious. this film was to begin a new trilogy to conclude the franchise. the film was released in 2017 and received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom praised the performances and action sequences, but criticized the storyline and the long running time. it was an unabashed commercial success, grossing over $1.2 billion worldwide. universal later announced that final two films will be released in may 2020 and april 2021, with lin returning to direct. it was announced that brewster would reprise her role as mia toretto, while screenwriter daniel casey was hired for the ninth film; f9 is the first film since tokyo drift not to be written by morgan. pre-production began in february 2019 in london, and filming began in june and concluded in november. john cena was cast as the film's villain, portraying jakob toretto, dom's brother. moreover, sung kang returned as han, while the film is the first to star helen mirren and saw lucas black reprise his role as sean boswell from tokyo drift. f9 was originally scheduled to be theatrically released on may 22, 2020, but was pushed back a year to april 2, 2021, due to the covid-19 pandemic. it was then pushed back to may 28, 2021, and finally released in the united states on june 25. it broke pandemic box office records, grossing $726 million worldwide.
fast x was designed to be the final movie of the franchise which later evolved in becoming a two part finale. justin lin was brought back to direct both movies but left the process early on due to on set differences with vin diesel. louis leterrier was then hired as his replacement to direct the two part finale. at universal's request, the two part finale was changed to a trilogy.


==== spin-off films ====
in 2015, diesel announced that potential spin-offs were in the early stages of development. in 2019, diesel announced a film that will focus on the women characters from the fast & furious and mentioned that there are three spin-off films in development. nicole perlman, lindsey beer and geneva robertson-dworet will serve as co-screenwriters on the project.the first spin-off, fast & furious presents: hobbs & shaw, was announced in 2018 and starred johnson and jason statham. in late 2017, variety reported morgan had written the script, while david leitch would direct. originally, the ninth film in the main series was supposed to be released in april 2019, followed by the tenth in april 2021. instead, universal opted to proceed with the spin-off, to occupy the 2019 release date. this caused tensions between johnson, diesel and gibson, with gibson responding through an instagram post, criticizing johnson for causing the ninth film to be delayed. johnson called out his male co-stars after completing the fate of the furious in a now deleted instagram post saying, "my male co-stars however are a different story. some conduct themselves as stand up men and true professionals, while others don't. the ones that don't are too chicken shit to do anything about it anyway. candy asses. when you watch this movie next april and it seems like i'm not acting in some of these scenes and my blood is legit boiling—you're right." johnson later cited scheduling issues as his refusal to participate in f9 and later confirmed he will not be in the final two fast and furious movies (fast x and its sequel) despite vin diesel asking him to return in an instagram post, with johnson calling diesel's attempt "manipulative". however, johnson made a cameo appearance at the end of fast x which indicated his potential involvement in its sequel.in october 2018, long-term producer neal h. moritz filed a lawsuit against universal pictures for breach of oral contract and committing promissory fraud after the distributor removed him as lead producer for hobbs & shaw. furthermore, it was revealed in may 2019 that universal dropped moritz from all future fast & furious installments. his lawsuit was settled in september 2020, and moritz would later return to the series with f9.


=== television series ===

in april 2016, dreamworks animation was acquired by nbcuniversal for $3.8 billion, with the acquisition including a first look deal with the company to produce animated projects based on or with films under the universal pictures banner. in april 2018, streaming service netflix green-lit the series fast & furious spy racers, with bret haaland, diesel, tim hedrick and morgan as executive producers and hedrick and haaland as showrunners. the series premiered on december 26, 2019, and ran for six seasons.
