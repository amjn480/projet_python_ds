washington, d.c., formally the district of columbia and commonly called washington or d.c., is the capital city and the federal district of the united states. the city is located on the east bank of the potomac river, which forms its southwestern border with virginia and borders maryland to its north and east. washington, d.c. was named for george washington, a founding father, victorious commanding general of the continental army in the american revolutionary war and the first president of the united states, who is widely considered the "father of his country". the district is named for columbia, the female personification of the nation.
washington, d.c. anchors the southern end of the northeast megalopolis, one of the nation's largest and most influential cultural, political, and economic regions that also includes some of the nation's largest and most prominent cities, including baltimore, boston, new york city, and philadelphia. as the seat of the u.s. federal government and several international organizations, the city is an important world political capital. the city had 20.7 million domestic visitors and 1.2 million international visitors, ranking seventh among u.s. cities as of 2022.the u.s. constitution provides for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the u.s. congress. as such, washington, d.c. is not part of any state, nor is it one itself. the residence act, adopted on july 16, 1790, approved the creation of the capital district along the potomac river. the city was founded in 1791, and congress held its first session there in 1800. in 1801, the district of columbia, formerly part of maryland and virginia and including the existing settlements of georgetown and alexandria, was officially recognized as the federal district; the city initially comprised only a portion of its modern territory, as a distinct entity within the larger federal district. in 1846, congress returned the land originally ceded by virginia, including the city of alexandria. in 1871, it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the district, though locally elected government lasted only three years and did not return for over a century. there have been several unsuccessful efforts to make the district into a state since the 1880s; a statehood bill passed the house of representatives in 2021 but was not adopted by the u.s. senate.designed in 1791 by pierre charles l'enfant, the city is divided into quadrants, which are centered around the capitol and include 131 neighborhoods. as of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 689,545, making it the 23rd-most populous city in the u.s., third-most populous city in the southeast after jacksonville and charlotte, and third-most populous city in the mid-atlantic after new york city and philadelphia. commuters from the city's maryland and virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek. the washington metropolitan area, which includes parts of maryland, virginia, and west virginia, is the country's sixth-largest metropolitan area with a 2020 population of 6.3 million residents.the city hosts all three branches of the u.s. federal government, congress (legislative), the president (executive), and the supreme court (judicial), and the governmental buildings that house most of the federal government, including the white house, the capitol, the supreme court building, and multiple federal departments and agencies. the city is home to many national monuments and museums, located primarily on or around the national mall, including the jefferson memorial, the lincoln memorial, and the washington monument. the city hosts 177 foreign embassies and serves as the headquarters for the world bank, the international monetary fund, the organization of american states, and other international organizations. many of the nation's largest industry associations, non-profit organizations, and think tanks are based in the city, including aarp, american red cross, atlantic council, brookings institution, national geographic society, the heritage foundation, wilson center, and others.
a locally elected mayor and 13-member council have governed the district since 1973, though congress is empowered to overturn local laws. washington, d.c. residents are, on a federal level, politically disenfranchised since the city's residents do not have voting representation in congress, although the city's residents elect a single at-large congressional delegate to the u.s. house of representatives who has no voting authority. the city's voters choose three presidential electors in accordance with the twenty-third amendment.


== history ==

various tribes of the algonquian-speaking piscataway people, also known as the conoy, inhabited the lands around the potomac river and present-day washington, d.c. when europeans first arrived and colonized the region in the early 17th century. the nacotchtank, also called the nacostines by catholic missionaries, maintained settlements around the anacostia river in present-day washington, d.c. conflicts with european colonists and neighboring tribes ultimately forced the piscataway people to relocate, some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near point of rocks, maryland.


=== founding ===
prior to the establishment of the city as the nation's capital in 1800, the nation's capital was philadelphia, which served as the capital on five separate occasions during the american revolution and its aftermath from may 1775 to july 1776, december 1776 to february 1777, march 1777 to september 1777, july 1778, july 1778 to march 1781, and march 1781 to june 1783. the continental congress was briefly based in five additional locations: york, pennsylvania in september 1777, princeton, new jersey in 1783, annapolis, maryland from november 1783 to august 1784, trenton, new jersey from november to december 1784, and new york city from january 1785 to march 1789.
on october 6, 1783, after the capital was forced by the pennsylvania mutiny of 1783 to relocate to princeton, new jersey, congress resolved to consider a new location for it. the following day, elbridge gerry of massachusetts moved "that buildings for the use of congress be erected on the banks of the delaware near trenton, or of the potomac, near georgetown, provided a suitable district can be procured on one of the rivers as aforesaid, for a federal town".in federalist no. 43, published january 23, 1788, james madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety. the pennsylvania mutiny of 1783 emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security.article one, section eight of the u.s. constitution permits the establishment of a "district (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of congress, become the seat of the government of the united states". however, the constitution does not specify a location for the capital. in the compromise of 1790, madison, alexander hamilton, and thomas jefferson agreed that the federal government would pay each state's remaining revolutionary war debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the southern united states.on july 9, 1790, congress passed the residence act, which approved the creation of a national capital on the potomac river. under the residence act, the exact location was to be selected by president george washington, who signed the bill into law on july 16, 1790. formed from land donated by maryland and virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16 km) on each side and totaling 100 square miles (259 km2).two pre existing settlements were included in the territory, the port of georgetown, founded in 1751, and the port city of alexandria, virginia, founded in 1749. in 1791 and 1792, a team led by andrew ellicott, including ellicott's brothers joseph and benjamin and african american astronomer benjamin banneker, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point; many of these stones are still standing.a new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the potomac river, to the east of georgetown. on september 9, 1791, three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of president washington. the same day, the federal district was named columbia, a feminine form of columbus, which was a poetic name for the united states commonly used at that time. congress held its first session there on november 17, 1800.congress passed the district of columbia organic act of 1801, which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. the area within the district was organized into two counties, the county of washington to the east and north of the potomac and the county of alexandria to the west and south. after the act's passage, citizens in the district were no longer considered residents of maryland or virginia, which ended their representation in congress.


=== burning during war of 1812 ===

on august 24, 1814, during the war of 1812, british forces invaded and occupied the city after defeating an american force at bladensburg. in retaliation for acts of destruction by american troops in the canadas, the british set fire to multiple government buildings in the city, including the united states capitol, the treasury building and the white house. all the buildings set on fire were gutted in what became known as the burning of washington. however, a storm forced the british to evacuate the city after just 24 hours. most government buildings were repaired quickly; however, the capitol was largely under construction at the time and was not completed in its current form until 1868.


=== retrocession and the civil war ===

in the 1830s, the district's southern territory of alexandria declined economically due in part to neglect of it by congress. alexandria was a major market in the domestic slave trade and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in congress would end slavery in the district, further depressing the local economy. alexandria's citizens petitioned virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the district through a process known as retrocession.the virginia general assembly voted in february 1846, to accept the return of alexandria. on july 9, 1846, congress went further, agreeing to return all territory that virginia had ceded to the district during its formation. this left the district's area consisting only of the portion originally donated by maryland. confirming the fears of pro-slavery alexandrians, the compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the district, although not slavery itself.the outbreak of the american civil war in 1861 led to the expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the city's population, including a large influx of freed slaves. president abraham lincoln signed the compensated emancipation act in 1862, which ended slavery in the district, freeing about 3,100 slaves in the district nine months prior to the emancipation proclamation. in 1868, congress granted the district's african american male residents the right to vote in municipal elections.


=== growth and redevelopment ===

by 1870, the district's population had grown 75% from the previous census to nearly 132,000 residents. despite the city's growth, however, washington still had dirt roads and the city lacked basic sanitation. some members of congress suggested moving the capital farther west, but president ulysses s. grant refused to consider the proposal.congress passed the organic act of 1871, which repealed the individual charters of the cities of washington and georgetown, abolished washington county, and created a new territorial government for the whole district of columbia and making "the city of washington...legally indistinguishable from the district of columbia."after the reorganization, in 1873, president grant appointed alexander robey shepherd as governor of the district of columbia. shepherd authorized large-scale projects that greatly modernized the city but ultimately bankrupted the district government. in 1874, congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member board of commissioners.in 1888, the city's first motorized streetcars began service. their introduction generated growth in areas of the district beyond the city of washington's original boundaries, leading to an expansion of the district over the next few decades. georgetown's street grid and other administrative details were formally merged to those of the city of washington in 1895. however, the city had poor housing conditions and strained public works, leading it to become the first city in the nation to undergo urban renewal projects as part of the city beautiful movement in the early 20th century.the city beautiful movement built heavily upon the already-implemented l'enfant plan, with the new mcmillan plan leading urban development in the city throughout the movement. much of the old victorian mall was replaced with modern neoclassical and beaux-arts architecture; these designs are still prevalent in the city's governmental buildings today.
increased federal spending as a result of the new deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings, memorials, and museums in the district, though the chairman of the house subcommittee on district appropriations ross a. collins from mississippi justified cuts to funds for welfare and education for local residents, saying that "my constituents wouldn't stand for spending money on niggers."world war ii led to an expansion of federal employees in the city; by 1950, the district's population reached its peak of 802,178 residents.


=== civil rights and home rule era ===

the twenty-third amendment to the united states constitution was ratified in 1961, granting the district three votes in the electoral college for the election of president and vice president, but still not affording the city's residents representation in congress.after the assassination of civil rights leader martin luther king jr. on april 4, 1968, riots broke out in the city, primarily in the u street, 14th street, 7th street, and h street corridors, which were predominantly black residential and commercial areas. the riots raged for three days until more than 13,600 federal troops and washington, d.c. army national guardsmen stopped the violence. many stores and other buildings were burned, and rebuilding from the riots was not completed until the late 1990s.in 1973, congress enacted the district of columbia home rule act providing for an elected mayor and 13-member council for the district. in 1975, walter washington became the district's first elected and first black mayor.since the 1980s, the d.c. statehood movement has grown in prominence. in 2016, a referendum on d.c. statehood resulted in an 85% support among washington, d.c. voters for it to become the nation's 51st state. in march 2017, the city's congressional delegate eleanor holmes norton introduced a bill for statehood. reintroduced in 2019 and 2021 as the washington, d.c., admission act, the u.s. house of representatives passed it in april 2021. after not progressing in the senate, the statehood bill was introduced again in january 2023.


== geography ==

washington, d.c., is located in the mid-atlantic region of the u.s. east coast. the city has a total area of 68.34 square miles (177 km2), of which 61.05 square miles (158.1 km2) is land and 7.29 square miles (18.9 km2) (10.67%) is water. the district is bordered by montgomery county, maryland, to the northwest; prince george's county, maryland, to the east; arlington county, virginia, to the west; and alexandria, virginia, to the south. washington is 38 miles (61 km) from baltimore, 124 miles (200 km) from philadelphia, 227 miles (365 km) from new york city, 242 miles (389 km) from pittsburgh, 384 miles (618 km) from charlotte, and 439 miles (707 km) from boston.the south bank of the potomac river forms the district's border with virginia and has two major tributaries, the anacostia river and rock creek. tiber creek, a natural watercourse that once passed through the national mall, was fully enclosed underground during the 1870s. the creek also formed a portion of the now-filled washington city canal, which allowed passage through the city to the anacostia river from 1815 until the 1850s. the chesapeake and ohio canal starts in georgetown and was used during the 19th century to bypass the little falls of the potomac river, located at the northwest edge of the city at the atlantic seaboard fall line.the highest natural elevation in the district is 409 feet (125 m) above sea level at fort reno park in upper northwest washington, d.c. the lowest point is sea level at the potomac river. the geographic center of washington is near the intersection of 4th and l streets nw.the district has 7,464 acres (30.21 km2) of parkland, about 19% of the city's total area and the second-highest percentage among high-density u.s. cities after philadelphia. the city's sizable parkland was a factor in the city being ranked as third in the nation for park access and quality in the 2018 parkscore ranking of the park systems of the nation's 100 most populous cities, according to trust for public land, a non-profit organization.the national park service manages most of the 9,122 acres (36.92 km2) of city land owned by the u.s. government. rock creek park is a 1,754-acre (7.10 km2) urban forest in northwest washington, which extends 9.3 miles (15.0 km) through a stream valley that bisects the city. established in 1890, it is the country's fourth-oldest national park and is home to a variety of plant and animal species, including raccoon, deer, owls, and coyotes. other national park service properties include the chesapeake and ohio canal national historical park, the national mall and memorial parks, theodore roosevelt island, columbia island, fort dupont park, meridian hill park, kenilworth park and aquatic gardens, and anacostia park. the district of columbia department of parks and recreation maintains the city's 900 acres (3.6 km2) of athletic fields and playgrounds, 40 swimming pools, and 68 recreation centers. the u.s. department of agriculture operates the 446-acre (1.80 km2) united states national arboretum in northeast washington, d.c.


=== climate ===

washington's climate is humid subtropical (köppen: cfa), or oceanic (trewartha: do bordering cf downtown). winters are cool to cold with some snow of varying intensity, while summers are hot and humid. the district is in plant hardiness zone 8a near downtown, and zone 7b elsewhere in the city.summers are hot and humid with a july daily average of 79.8 °f (26.6 °c) and average daily relative humidity around 66%, which can cause moderate personal discomfort. heat indices regularly approach 100 °f (38 °c) at the height of summer. the combination of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area.blizzards affect washington once every four to six years on average. the most violent storms, known as nor'easters, often impact large regions of the east coast. from january 27 to 28, 1922, the city officially received 28 inches (71 cm) of snowfall, the largest snowstorm since official measurements began in 1885. according to notes kept at the time, the city received between 30 and 36 inches (76 and 91 cm) from a snowstorm in january 1772.hurricanes or their remnants occasionally impact the area in late summer and early fall. however, they usually are weak by the time they reach washington, partly due to the city's inland location. flooding of the potomac river, however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive property damage in the georgetown neighborhood of the city. precipitation occurs throughout the year.the highest recorded temperature was 106 °f (41 °c) on august 6, 1918, and on july 20, 1930. the lowest recorded temperature was −15 °f (−26 °c) on february 11, 1899, right before the great blizzard of 1899. during a typical year, the city averages about 37 days at or above 90 °f (32 °c) and 64 nights at or below the freezing mark (32 °f or 0 °c). on average, the first day with a minimum at or below freezing is november 18 and the last day is march 27.

== cityscape ==

washington, d.c., was a planned city, and many of the city's street grids were developed in that initial plan. in 1791, president george washington commissioned pierre (peter) charles l'enfant, a french-born architect and city planner, to design the new capital, and enlisted scottish surveyor alexander ralston to help lay out the city plan. the l'enfant plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles, providing room for open space and landscaping. l'enfant based his design on plans of other major world cities, including paris, amsterdam, karlsruhe, and milan that thomas jefferson had sent to him.: 22  l'enfant's design also envisioned a garden-lined grand avenue approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) in length and 400 feet (120 m) wide in area that is now the national mall. in march 1792, however, president washington dismissed l'enfant due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capital's construction. andrew ellicott, who worked with l'enfant in surveying the city, was then tasked with completing its design. though ellicott revised the original l'enfant plans, including changing some street patterns, l'enfant is still credited with the city's overall design.by the early 20th century, however, l'enfant's vision of a grand national capital was marred by slums and randomly placed buildings in the city, including a railroad station on the national mall. congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying washington's ceremonial core. what became known as the mcmillan plan was finalized in 1901 and included relandscaping the capitol grounds and the national mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. the plan is thought to have largely preserved l'enfant's intended design for the city.by law, the city's skyline is low and sprawling. the federal height of buildings act of 1910 prohibits buildings exceeding the width of the adjacent street plus 20 feet (6.1 m). despite popular belief, no law has ever limited buildings to the height of the united states capitol or the 555-foot (169 m) washington monument, which remains the district's tallest structure. city leaders have criticised the height restriction as a primary reason why the district has limited affordable housing and traffic problems caused partly by suburban sprawl. washington d.c. still has a relatively high homelessness rate, despite its high living standard compared to many american cities.
washington, d.c. is divided into four quadrants of unequal area: northwest (nw), northeast (ne), southeast (se), and southwest (sw). the axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the u.s. capitol. all road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location and house numbers generally correspond with the number of blocks away from the capitol. most streets are set out in a grid pattern with east–west streets named with letters (e.g., c street sw), north–south streets with numbers (e.g., 4th street nw), and diagonal avenues, many of which are named after states.selection of neighborhoods in washington, d.c.
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
the city of washington was bordered by boundary street to the north, later renamed florida avenue in 1890, rock creek to the west, and the anacostia river to the east. washington, d.c.'s street grid was extended, where possible, throughout the district starting in 1888. georgetown's streets were renamed in 1895. some streets are particularly noteworthy, including pennsylvania avenue, which connects the white house to the capitol, and k street, which houses the offices of many lobbying groups. constitution avenue and independence avenue, located on the north and south sides of the national mall, respectively, are home to many of washington's iconic museums, including the smithsonian institution buildings and the national archives building. washington hosts 177 foreign embassies, constituting approximately 297 buildings beyond the more than 1,600 residential properties owned by foreign countries, many of which are on a section of massachusetts avenue informally known as embassy row.


=== architecture ===

the architecture of washington, d.c., varies greatly and is generally popular among tourists and locals. in 2007, six of the top ten buildings in the american institute of architects' ranking of america's favorite architecture were in the city: the white house, washington national cathedral, the jefferson memorial, the united states capitol, the lincoln memorial, and the vietnam veterans memorial. the neoclassical, georgian, gothic, and modern styles are reflected among these six structures and many other prominent edifices in the city.many of the government buildings, monuments, and museums along the national mall and surrounding areas are heavily inspired by classical roman and greek architecture. the designs of the white house, the u.s. capitol, supreme court building, washington monument, national gallery of art, lincoln memorial, and jefferson memorial are all heavily drawn from these classical architectural movements and feature large pediments, domes, columns in classical order, and heavy stone walls. notable exceptions to the city's classical-style architecture include buildings constructed in the french second empire style, including the eisenhower executive office building. the thomas jefferson building, the main library of congress building, and the historic willard hotel are built in beaux-arts style, popular throughout the world in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  meridian hill park contains a cascading waterfall with italian renaissance-style architecture.modern, postmodern, contemporary, and other non-classical architectural styles are also seen in the city's buildings. the national museum of african american history and culture deeply contrasts the stone-based neoclassical buildings on the national mall with a design that combines modern engineering with heavy inspiration from african art. the interior of the washington metro stations and the hirshhorn museum and sculpture garden are designed with strong influence from the 20th-century brutalism movement. the smithsonian institution building is built of seneca red sandstone in the norman revival style. the old post office building, located on pennsylvania avenue and completed in 1899, was the first building in the city to have a steel frame structure and the first to utilize electrical wiring in its design.notable contemporary residential buildings, restaurants, shops, and office buildings in the city include the wharf on the southwest waterfront, navy yard along the anacostia river, and citycenterdc in downtown. the wharf, given its proximity to the potomac river, has seen the construction of several high-rise office and residential buildings overlooking the river. additionally, restaurants, bars, and shops have been opened at street level. many of these buildings have a modern glass exterior and heavy curvature. citycenterdc is home to palmer alley, a pedestrian-only walkway, and houses several apartment buildings, restaurants, and luxury-brand storefronts with streamlined glass and metal facades.outside downtown d.c., architectural styles are more varied. historic buildings are designed primarily in the queen anne, châteauesque, richardsonian romanesque, georgian revival, beaux-arts, and a variety of victorian styles. rowhouses are prominent in areas developed after the civil war and typically follow federal and late victorian designs. georgetown's old stone house, built in 1765, is the oldest-standing building in the city. founded in 1789, georgetown university features a mix of romanesque and gothic revival architecture. the ronald reagan building is the largest building in the district with a total area of approximately 3.1 million square feet (288,000 m2). washington union station is designed from a combination of different architectural styles. its great hall, which serves as the main hall within the building, has elaborate gold leaf designs along the ceilings and the hall includes several decorative classical-style statues.


== demographics ==

the u.s. census bureau estimates that the district's population was 705,749 as of july 2019, an increase of more than 100,000 people compared to the 2010 united states census. when measured on a decade-over-decade basis, this continues a growth trend since 2000, following a half-century of population decline. but on a year-over-year basis, the july 2019 census count shows a population decline of 16,000 individuals over the preceding 12-month period. washington was the 24th most populous place in the united states as of 2010. according to data from 2010, commuters from the suburbs increase the district's daytime population to over a million. if the district were a state it would rank 49th in population, ahead of vermont and wyoming.the washington metropolitan area, which includes the district and surrounding suburbs, is the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the u.s. with an estimated six million residents as of 2016. when the washington area is included with baltimore and its suburbs, it forms the vast washington–baltimore combined statistical area. with a population exceeding 9.8 million residents in 2020, it is the third-largest combined statistical area in the country.according to hud's 2022 annual homeless assessment report, there were an estimated 4,410 homeless people in washington, d.c.according to 2017 census bureau data, the population of washington, d.c. was 47.1% black or african american, 45.1% white (36.8% non-hispanic white), 4.3% asian, 0.6% american indian or alaska native, and 0.1% native hawaiian or other pacific islander. individuals from two or more races made up 2.7% of the population. hispanics of any race made up 11.0% of the district's population.washington, d.c. has had a significant african american population since the city's foundation. african american residents composed about 30% of the district's total population between 1800 and 1940. the black population reached a peak of 70% by 1970, but has since steadily declined due to many african americans moving to the surrounding suburbs. partly as a result of gentrification, there was a 31.4% increase in the non-hispanic white population and an 11.5% decrease in the black population between 2000 and 2010. according to a study by the national community reinvestment coalition, d.c. has experienced more "intense" gentrification than any other american city, with 40% of neighborhoods gentrified.approximately 17% of washington, d.c. residents were age 18 or younger as of 2010, lower than the u.s. average of 24%. however, at 34 years old, the district had the lowest median age compared to the 50 states as of 2010. as of 2010, there were an estimated 81,734 immigrants living in washington, d.c. major sources of immigration include el salvador, ethiopia, mexico, guatemala, and china, with a concentration of salvadorans in the mount pleasant neighborhood.as of 2010, there were 4,822 same-sex couples in the city, about 2% of total households, according to williams institute. legislation authorizing same-sex marriage passed in 2009, and the district began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in march 2010.

=== budgetary issues ===
the mayor and council set local taxes and a budget, which congress must approve. the government accountability office and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the district's local budget of anywhere between $470 million and over $1 billion per year. congress typically provides additional grants for federal programs such as medicaid and the operation of the local justice system; however, analysts claim that the payments do not fully resolve the imbalance.the city's local government, particularly during the mayoralty of marion barry, has been criticized for mismanagement and waste. during his administration in 1989, washington monthly magazine labeled the district "the worst city government in america". in 1995, at the start of barry's fourth term, congress created the district of columbia financial control board to oversee all municipal spending. mayor anthony williams won election in 1998 and oversaw a period of urban renewal and budget surpluses.the district regained control over its finances in 2001 and the oversight board's operations were suspended.the district has a federally funded "emergency planning and security fund" to cover security related to visits by foreign leaders and diplomats, presidential inaugurations, protests, and terrorism concerns. during the trump administration, the fund has run with a deficit. trump's january 2017 inauguration cost the city $27 million; of that, $7 million was never repaid to the fund. trump's 2019 independence day event, "a salute to america", cost six times more than independence day events in past years.


=== voting rights debate ===

washington, d.c. is not a state and therefore has no federal voting representation in congress. the city's residents elect a non-voting delegate to the house of representatives (d.c. at-large), who may sit on committees, participate in debate, and introduce legislation, but cannot vote on the house floor. the district has no official representation in the united states senate. neither chamber seats the district's elected "shadow" representative or senators. unlike residents of u.s. territories such as puerto rico or guam, which also have non-voting delegates, d.c. residents are subject to all federal taxes. in the financial year 2012, d.c. residents and businesses paid $20.7 billion in federal taxes, more than the taxes collected from 19 states and the highest federal taxes per capita.a 2005 poll found that 78% of americans did not know residents of washington, d.c., have less representation in congress than residents of the 50 states. efforts to raise awareness about the issue have included campaigns by grassroots organizations and featuring the city's unofficial motto, "end taxation without representation", on d.c. vehicle license plates. there is evidence of nationwide approval for d.c. voting rights; various polls indicate that 61 to 82% of americans believe d.c. should have voting representation in congress.opponents to federal voting rights for washington, d.c., propose that the founding fathers never intended for district residents to have a vote in congress since the constitution makes clear that representation must come from the states. those opposed to making district of columbia a state claim such a move would destroy the notion of a separate national capital and that statehood would unfairly grant senate representation to a single city.


=== homelessness ===
