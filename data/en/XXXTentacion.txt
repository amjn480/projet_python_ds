it was a lack of appreciation on his end, not because of me, i guess just from a business perspective. but he put a business perspective before a personal relationship, and i've been with him as a friend and as a brother for a very long time. i mean, it's just on some other shit to be honest. it's not on anything i've done wrong. i can't even say i've done anything to him, and i wouldn't go on the internet and express that if i didn't care about the relationship, but you already know how it goes. they use you to where they wanna go and then part ways. and i've been used a lot if you haven't noticed.

=== stabbing of tablez ===
dylan turner, known professionally as tablez, a new jersey native studying at full sail university, managed xxxtentacion and his best friend ski mask the slump god in 2016. due to onfroy's inexperience in music and tablez's inexperience in management, they agreed that tablez would be paid only in the proceeds from the song "look at me!".one night, ski mask and tablez got into an argument while at tablez's apartment, which led to ski mask storming out. ski mask later called onfroy while drunk and lied that tablez had taken thousands from onfroy. according to tablez's account, days later an angry onfroy and others broke into tablez's apartment and onfroy shouted, "what if i stab you? what if i fucking stab you?" while poking a knife towards tablez's stomach, stopping just a few inches short and then pulling back. tablez said that he did not know if onfroy meant to stab him, because onfroy said in shock, "oh fuck", after tablez exclaimed to onfroy that he had stabbed him. however, the blade sank into his abdomen. tablez recounted that onfroy and the others then stole his laptop and fled.tablez required emergency surgery and suffered life-changing injuries. he pledged to drop charges against onfroy if his computer could be returned, saying that he "didn't want one bad choice to define who [onfroy] was." tablez stuck to his word despite all its files being deleted. onfroy paid for the entirety of tablez's hospital bills, and later apologized to tablez and thanked him for dropping the charges, stating to him, "thank you for dropping the charges. as fucked up as the situation is, i am forever in your debt." when asked if he thought onfroy was genuinely changing later in life to become a better person, tablez responded, "yes. deep down we all are."


=== robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and home invasion charges ===
on july 14, 2016, days after being bailed for stabbing tablez, onfroy was arrested and charged with robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and home invasion committed in november 2015. according to the arrest report, onfroy entered the home of che thomas with three other people, armed with a firearm. after pistol-whipping thomas three times, onfroy escaped the home with an ipad, an iphone, a sony playstation portable, and $20.onfroy was arrested in orlando originally, but was later transferred to orange county. his constant relocations were due to an eventually successful plan by prosecutors to find a jurisdiction that would charge him as an adult for a crime committed as a juvenile. he was released on a $10,000 bond in september 2016. following thomas requesting that onfroy not receive prison time, onfroy pleaded no contest to the charges and was ultimately sentenced to six years probation.


=== domestic violence and witness tampering charges ===
after posting the bail of $10,000 in early october of the same year, while awaiting trial, onfroy was arrested again later that month on charges of aggravated battery of a pregnant woman, domestic battery, and false imprisonment. on march 26, 2017, onfroy was released from jail on a $50,000 bail while facing charges of robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. his trial for the domestic violence and witness tampering charges was originally going to take place in may 2017 and was pushed back several times, and was set to take place on october 5, 2017.on september 8, 2017, pitchfork leaked the testimony of the alleged victim in onfroy's case. the trial was then delayed again with a date of december 11, 2017, announced. controversy arose once again following onfroy's choice to donate $100,000 to domestic violence prevention programs, and then further when onfroy announced an event to support rape victims though it was later canceled due to vandalism.

onfroy's trial was delayed again after an affidavit was filed by onfroy's ex-girlfriend geneva ayala, the alleged victim in the case, asking for the charges to be "completely dropped". she also declined to testify in court, making the battery charges being dropped or an acquittal of onfroy on the charges more likely. in reaction, the prosecution moved to split the domestic violence and witness tampering case into two, with additional witness tampering charges being filed against onfroy and a new trial date announced for december 15, 2017. despite this, sources close to ayala said the letter was genuine and that she wanted to move on. ayala revealed after onfroy's death that she was against onfroy receiving prison time.on december 10, 2017, onfroy posted a message to instagram, writing "court date is on the 15th 9:00 am here is my court information, if i am taken into custody, i want to tell everyone i've let down i apologize, i tried my best, i really did ..."; he then released the information of the court hearing.onfroy pleaded not guilty on december 14, 2017, and was taken into pretrial custody after a motion was filed by the prosecution on the grounds of onfroy having violated his bond. he was held without bail. it was confirmed on december 20, 2017, that onfroy was being released on house arrest. onfroy was released from house arrest on march 21, 2018.onfroy's lead attorney, j. david bogenschutz said after onfroy's death that he believed onfroy would have avoided a prison sentence and would have instead been sentenced to probation if he was convicted of any of the charges, since the judge presiding over the case, richard hersch, had appeared to begin to look more favorably upon him, even granting him permission to go on tour. hersch had also issued a gag order on recordings related to onfroy's case while it was ongoing. onfroy's domestic violence charges, which he was awaiting trial for, were voluntarily dropped by the prosecution following his death.in 2019, documents and audio of phone calls that onfroy made to his mother from jail were released, in which onfroy claimed that his ex-girlfriend may have not been pregnant and claimed that it was his female friends who beat ayala for getting onfroy sent to a "mental asylum". onfroy had been involuntarily hospitalized under florida's baker act in 2016 after ayala and onfroy's roommates reported to police that he had attempted suicide.


=== controversy over snapchat video, false accusation threats, and defamation lawsuit ===
shortly after being released from house arrest, a snapchat video surfaced of onfroy hitting a girl, breonna starling, in 2013 when he was 15. onfroy's attorneys claimed the video, which features a caption written by starling that sardonically reads "i hate this nigga" along with onfroy dancing to some music before striking the girl, was "obviously . . . in jest".onfroy claimed afterwards that he was afraid he was going to be financially extorted by starling and that members of her family had already called him requesting money. starling came forward several days later saying she was "terrified for her life"; however, according to tmz, onfroy intended to sue starling for fraud and defamation after her family demanded a large sum of money in exchange for her silence.according to the legal complaint against starling, after the video appeared on reddit, onfroy's manager, solomon sobande, messaged starling on instagram, stating to her, "hey, this is solomon, [onfroy's] manager. please get back to me at your earliest convenience." a few hours later, sobande received a call from starling. she stated to sobande, "i already know why you're calling. i don't know why everyone is making a big deal out of this video. we were only playing around, and that video was years ago. what the hell is wrong with people?" sobande asked starling if she could release a statement stating what she had said in the call, and she immediately agreed. a few hours later, sobande received a phone call from the same number, but starling's grandparents were the ones on the phone. they said they were extremely upset with the video, and after sobande had stated that she told him that the video was in jest, they denied starling having stated that. after the call, starling blocked sobande on instagram. the complaint alleged that starling, her grandparents, and an attorney had discussed the potential of the video for them to receive great financial gain, and demanded $300,000 in exchange for starling's silence, and additionally threatened to falsely accuse onfroy of brandishing a bb gun prior to the video. additionally, the complaint stated that starling had changed her tone after learning of onfroy's ongoing criminal domestic violence case with ayala, threatening to hold a press conference to "show the world how violent onfroy is."starling later released a statement admitting that the version of events described by onfroy and his team were correct, and that she "hope[d] that people see the video in the playful context in which it was recorded and nothing more". after starling's admission, onfroy dropped his lawsuit against her.


=== leaked audio regarding domestic violence and a stabbing incident ===
on october 23, 2018, pitchfork released secretly recorded audio of 18-year-old onfroy talking with acquaintances around the time of his october 8, 2016, arrest. pitchfork alleged that he had confessed to domestic violence in the recording and described an incident in which he stabbed eight people. the tape was considered a confession by the prosecution and defense. an extended version of the audio later released included moments after when onfroy clarified in regards to his ex-girlfriend, "i didn't touch her. i forgave her."one especially fraught conversation about onfroy's ex-girlfriend took place on the afternoon of october 26, 2016, when he told a woman, "i already got what i wanted, i already bashed her face—her face on the internet, bruh, i done made her look bad on the internet, bruh." later that day, an audio clip from the call was posted on instagram of onfroy saying he "bashed her face" without the hurried clarification.on the later released full version of the recording, onfroy is heard saying that he has "no pride looking in the mirror" and that he "disgusts himself" for not being able to control his anger. onfroy said that he used to "fuck [his ex-girlfriend] up" for cheating on him, but from then on he forgave her and would not touch her again. some have tried to claim that when onfroy said he used to "fuck her up" he meant "mentally". rolling stone journalist and author jonathan reiss said in his biography of onfroy that this claim is "illogical in context."onfroy went on in the recording to describe the trauma he had experienced, from witnessing someone's tongue being cut out, to witnessing someone being raped, and someone attempting to kill his mother. pitchfork faced criticism for not including these details of onfroy's trauma and remorse in their article on the recording. jonathan reiss said that pitchfork "presented [the recording] out of context and carefully chose the most damning portion that they could find."pitchfork also faced criticism for their interpretation of the stabbing incident that onfroy described, as it was argued by some that he and his friend were about to be jumped and that he acted in self-defense. it was revealed later that onfroy appeared to have indeed acted in self-defense, as a video of the incident showed that he and his friend, record producer khaed were about to be jumped by around twenty-five to forty people surrounding them.

"his favorite thing was to just backhand my mouth", ayala says. "that always left welts inside my lips."the first incident of domestic violence allegedly occurred when onfroy slapped ayala and broke her iphone 6s, because she had complimented a male friend on his new jewelry. onfroy later repaired the phone. in one incident recounted to a prosecutor, ayala said onfroy asked her which object she wanted him to force into her vagina: a long-handled barbecue fork, or a wire barbecue brush, she chose the fork and onfroy told her to undress. she claimed onfroy was lightly dragging the tool against her inner thigh when she passed out; he did not penetrate her with it. ayala stated that once she woke up, onfroy started apologizing to her profusely for the incident. following the alleged incidents, ayala started a gofundme page, claiming she needed surgery for damage to her left eye. she raised over $32,000, including $5,000 being donated by onfroy. the fundraiser was temporarily suspended by gofundme due to allegations of fraud. it was never confirmed whether ayala had the surgery done.ayala said that onfroy would often guilt her with near-attempts at suicide. ayala said he used to fill a bathtub with water then fetch the microwave and dangle it over, threatening to let go. another time he allegedly dangled himself from a 12th-story balcony by his legs and threatened suicide again after learning that ayala had cheated on him during his time in jail. a witness to the incident stated that ayala began to "box" onfroy's face after the incident, to which ayala admitted, but said that it was the only time she hit onfroy. after onfroy's death, ayala said in regards to those discussing her accusations against onfroy, "it's disgusting that people are speaking for me." responding to those who criticized her for mourning onfroy after his death, ayala said on her instagram story, "did y'all know him? no, y'all did not. i knew who the fuck he was… i still fucking love him. i lost someone very dear to me and i can grieve whenever the fuck i fucking want to." onfroy maintained his innocence publicly until his death.roommates of both onfroy and ayala describe onfroy's remorse after the alleged incidents, and say that onfroy said he "badly wanted to control his anger". this included an occasion where onfroy was described as falling to his knees and weeping, begging to himself for his behavior to change. some psychologists have speculated that onfroy may have suffered from an attachment disorder stemming from the absence of his mother and father during childhood, which could have made him prone to uncontrollable violent outbursts. onfroy was re-diagnosed with bipolar disorder as an adult after initially being diagnosed as a child. onfroy had been seeing a therapist and began taking medication by the time of his death.on new year's eve 2017, onfroy entered a relationship with jenesis sanchez, which eventually became a domestic partnership. sanchez said that in their relationship onfroy showed changes in controlling his anger and would simply walk away if an argument ensued, rather than ever being physical. onfroy began saying that he saw his deceased friend, jocelyn flores as his "guardian angel" and that it helped him to make better decisions in his relationship. three days after his death, onfroy's mother announced on instagram that sanchez was pregnant with his child. in an interview, sanchez said onfroy was notified three weeks before he passed. the baby was confirmed to be a boy on august 22, 2018, and was born on january 26, 2019, three days after what would have been his father's 21st birthday.a couple of weeks after sanchez requested onfroy's dna samples to prove the paternity of her son, onfroy's mother filed to block the test. onfroy's mother sealed her court filings in opposition, so it is unclear why she objects to a paternity test. some fans suspect it has something to do with her financial stake in onfroy's estate. on may 15, 2019, sanchez won the legal battle and a florida judge granted access to a dna sample from onfroy.


=== religious and spiritual beliefs ===
onfroy, who was raised a christian, had a well-documented interest in the occult. miami new times journalist tarpley hitt, who conducted one of few mainstream media interviews with him, reflected that he spent most of the two-hour conversation speaking on the subject at the expense of answering questions on his childhood or criminal charges. housemates from his time living with the pornographic actor bruno dickemz recalled that he had a collection of books on occult and took part in rituals. while living there, his former partner geneva ayala pretended to be demonically possessed as a way to scare him out of their turbulent relationship, but it instead fascinated him. he was inspired by austrian philosopher rudolf steiner's anthroposophy philosophy and its teachings about consciousness.on his xxl freshman cypher and his track "i spoke to the devil in miami, he said everything would be fine", onfroy mentioned selling his soul to satan; when questioned by dj akademiks on the subject, he refused to answer, concerned that he could encourage "kids going down that dark path". additionally, on his track "daemons", onfroy discusses a revenge fantasy against jesus and god for allowing atrocities in the world, while expressing skepticism about the existence of god. specifically, onfroy describes seeking revenge upon god for allowing his uncle's mental suffering. onfroy's uncle committed suicide by hanging when onfroy was a child.onfroy believed in reincarnation, picturing the cycle of death and rebirth as ending when one lives a life without harming others; he believed he had failed in this due to his violence. he was fascinated by the new age concept of indigo children, which may have been the reason for his attraction toward the color blue in the final months of his life.


== politics ==
onfroy was public about his political and personal beliefs throughout his career. in 2016, onfroy opposed the presidential candidacy of donald trump and had instead signaled support for democratic candidate bernie sanders. he also took to twitter predicting a trump victory, saying, "as much as i hate that piece of shit donald trump, y'all know this motherfucker's gonna win right?" he also stated that, although he did not hold a positive opinion of democratic nominee hillary clinton, describing her as "garbage", he did not want trump to win because, "once trump gets in it's over for all the minorities pretty much... the lower classes are gonna be fucked." his songs "hate will never win" and "suicide pit" contain anti-trump lyrics.onfroy said he believed that, "if weed was legal everywhere, the world would be a better place", and voiced support for criminal justice reform movements, stating that "the judicial system is slavery." onfroy was anti-war and spoke out against president trump's decision to launch a missile strike on syria in april 2017.despite previously expressing opposition to gun control measures, onfroy reversed his stance on the issue following the 2018 stoneman douglas high school shooting in parkland, florida. onfroy held multiple charity events for the march for our lives movement and visited parkland survivor anthony borges in the hospital while borges was recovering from gunshot wounds.onfroy was characterized by much of the media as homophobic following a widely seen interview he gave to adam22 in april 2016. onfroy told adam22 that, one time when he was in a juvenile detention facility, he attacked his gay cellmate for staring at him while naked. onfroy explained, "i was gonna kill him type shit because of what he did", but was ultimately restrained. after onfroy's death, liz lazzara's article for cnn described him as homophobic, and similar characterizations were made on social media. however, friends and collaborators said he was not homophobic. in the same interview, onfroy stated in clarification, "i am not homophobic", and expressed his support for the legalization of gay marriage. in a 2017 interview with the fader which was released in november 2022, onfroy mentioned that he should have been clearer in the podcast in which he described the fight, stating he wished he had clarified that he did not attack his cellmate for the fact that he was gay, calling his discussion of the topic "negligent and stupid", but stated, "everybody needs to realize at the time i was still a kid." regarding his political beliefs, onfroy was praised as "incredibly progressive" by transgender music producer fifty grand. multiple transgender artists said in a 2020 biography that onfroy was supportive of the transgender community.onfroy said many times that he distrusted police due to both personal experiences and publicized instances such as the killing of philando castile, which onfroy described as a murder. in the music video for "riot", depictions of the killings of emmett till, heather heyer, and philando castile are shown, in addition to the fictional depiction at the end of the video of a white child being lynched. onfroy said that the last depiction wasn't an expression of reverse racism, but was to show that public outrage from the video would be more so focused on the fictional white child's death rather than the depictions of actual racist killings. onfroy expressed frustration in a 2017 interview that the officer who killed eric garner was not arrested.during the revenge concert tour, onfroy had publicly declared his support for civil rights and gay rights, and denounced racist and homophobic rhetoric from hate groups such as the kkk, saying, "i don't give a fuck if you're black, white, yellow, purple—i don't give a fuck if you're gay, i don't give a fuck if you're straight, i give a fuck if you're a person... i stand for equality for all people."

highlighting his ambivalent public reception during his short career, billboard wrote:"the provocative and polarizing artist seemed to thrive on controversy as much as art, often blurring the lines between shocking reality and button-pushing creativity. xxx's short career was characterized by both in equal measure-making the florida rapper a martyr to a legion of fans and a cautionary tale to so many others."on june 18, 2019, exactly one year on from xxxtentacion's death, an official documentary on his life was announced; it featured footage of onfroy from around april 2017 telling biographical details. on february 2, 2022, it was announced that the film, titled look at me, would be released on the hulu streaming service on may 26, 2022.xxxtentacion has riaa-certified sales of 38 million units in the us and bpi-certified sales of over 7 million units in the uk. he is also one of the top-20 all-time best selling artists in terms of digital singles, with a total of 49 million riaa-certified digital sales as of october 2020. in august 2021, xxxtentacion's single, "sad!", was certified diamond in the us.

=== controversy ===
xxxtentacion's personal life and history are noted as prominent parts of his legacy. an article in the guardian described his legacy in more critical terms, stating that "he will be remembered mostly for the unusually cruel violence he committed on vulnerable people, particularly his ex-girlfriend, crimes for which he never expressed remorse." mutual friends of both xxxtentacion and his ex-girlfriend dispute this narrative, recalling times when he had broken down in remorse. according to the article, his music "reflected a life lived with disregard for humanity, both other people's and his own" and rarely attempted to engage in bravado or bragging, instead focusing on "mental illness, suicide, extreme misogyny, and a prevailing feeling of numbness", though acknowledging that xxxtentacion "made some attempts to rehabilitate his image."in an article for the atlantic, hannah giorgis expressed similar criticisms, though she also noted that xxxtentacion "reminded young fans in particular that their hurt was valid but that it did not form the sum total of their lives" and that he "gave voice to their insecurities." contrasting these elements of his legacy, giorgis acknowledged that though xxxtentacion spent his career encouraging young fans to recognize their greater worth, she believed his legacy is nonetheless characterized by the trauma he both experienced and caused.in the washington post, chris richards commented on xxxtentacion's complicated legacy, contrasting how he "encouraged his fans to find hope in the fog of their despair, but bragged enthusiastically about the joy he felt in brutalizing others." according to richards, xxxtentacion's music "brought solace to the depressed" while validating the sort of violence he practiced, and legitimized the pain of his fans while erasing the suffering of domestic violence victims. xxxtentacion's music serves as an example for richards of how "a hateful song" might normalize such feelings in "hateful people", which contributes to the profound paranoia in society about the hatred that might be in the minds of others.in an article for vibe, while acknowledging xxxtentacion's controversial history, shenequa golding criticized those celebrating his murder. golding commented in response to these reactions, "jahseh was 20 years old, which means five years ago, he was 15, and 10 years ago, he was 10. his death has required that we be the bigger person and acknowledge and respect that his life was taken, even though he didn't offer the same courtesy through his music and actions... if this 20-year-old was killed, and some of us find joy in that, how much have we exfoliated away at our own empathy and humanity? how raw have we become?" golding stated that although she would not condone xxxtentacion's past actions, "he should at least earn your silence, because being delighted and vocal about his untimely death, despite his horrid past, is just wrong."in an article for slate, jack hamilton shared similar sentiments to golding, warning of the slippery slope of moral absolutism in the wake of xxxtentacion's death, calling those celebrating his murder "self-righteous" and stating, "i have trouble mining any feelings of superiority or 'justice' from the killing of a 20-year-old, no matter what he did in his life." hamilton added that he disagreed with the notion that xxxtentacion was irredeemable, "but now he'll never have a chance." hamilton also cautioned against demonizing xxxtentacion's fans, writing, "those people just lost an artist who was important to them, who spoke to and for them when no one else seemed to, who just died in an act of brutal violence, and almost all of us of at any age know what that's like."jordan bassett of nme additionally shared a similar point of view to that of golding and hamilton, writing, "[xxxtentacion] was exposed to unspeakable violence in his past; we know patterns of abuse repeat themselves. this of course is not an attempt to excuse the things he did, but it does suggest they were the actions of a damaged child, rather than the twisted bogeyman he was depicted as on social media." in an interview with nme, rapper and singer juice wrld gave a defense of xxxtentacion, commenting, "everybody has their mistakes. a mistake is a mistake. some are more severe than others, but we're no one to judge the severity of someone's mistake. as long as we doin' wrong, as long as we sinnin', you can't judge nobody else's mistakes."rolling stone journalist and author jonathan reiss, who authored a 2020 biography of xxxtentacion, criticized the media's portrayal of xxxtentacion, saying, "they bundled his sins into listicles and timelines, partaking in an almost gluttonous level of hatred. they made a monster and sold it." reiss also wrote, "one of the saddest outcomes of losing x so young is that he never got to take responsibility for his actions, but given all he did in that last year and how far he'd come, it's not far-fetched to imagine that he may have." reiss commented on xxxtentacion's legacy in more favorable terms, writing, "if being a fan of xxxtentacion or jahseh onfroy could mean being a believer in second chances and the power of redemption… that would be a hell of a powerful legacy."xxxtentacion's ex-girlfriend geneva ayala, who had accused him of domestic abuse in 2016, said of the controversy surrounding her and onfroy's past, "it's disgusting that people are speaking for me. i don't care if no one cared about me however many months ago, i didn't lose my life. he did. it's permanent. i'm still here. like, how do you think that makes me feel? everyone expecting me to be relieved or happy? no, i'm broken." following xxxtentacion's death, ayala appeared in the music video and the cover art for the 2019 single "hearteater".
