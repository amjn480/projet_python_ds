the main series consists of nine video games taking place in locations connected to a fictional family pizza restaurant franchise named "freddy fazbear's pizza", after its mascot, the animatronic bear freddy fazbear. in most games, the player assumes the role of a night-time employee, who must utilize tools such as security cameras, lights, doors, and vents to defend themselves against animatronic characters who inhabit the locations and become mobile and hostile at night. the series' lore is gradually revealed through voice recordings, minigames, and easter eggs featured throughout the games.

== history and development ==
the idea for five nights at freddy's stemmed from the negative reception of scott cawthon's previous game, the family-friendly chipper & sons lumber co. players said that the main character (a young beaver) looked like "a scary animatronic animal", and reviewer james sterling called the game "unintentionally terrifying". initially discouraged by the criticism, cawthon (who had previously primarily developed christian-oriented games) eventually used the feedback to make something intentionally scarier.five nights at freddy's was released via desura on august 8, 2014. on august 20, after it was approved by the service's crowdsourcing platform greenlight, five nights at freddy's was also released on steam. when the game was picked up by well-known youtubers it became an internet sensation.: 82 the sequels were released on november 10, 2014, march 2, 2015, july 23, 2015, october 7, 2016, december 4, 2017, june 27, 2018, may 28, 2019, november 25, 2019, and december 16, 2021, respectively. a spin-off from the series, fnaf world, was announced in a steam post by cawthon in september 2015, and was released in january 2016. free downloadable content for security breach, titled fnaf: security breach ruin, was subsequently released on july 25, 2023. cawthon releases teasers for his games on his website, and trailers on his youtube channel.
cawthon used clickteam fusion 2.5 to create the five nights at freddy's games and autodesk 3ds max to model and render the games' 3d graphics. to enhance sister location, pizzeria simulator, ultimate custom night, help wanted, and special delivery, cawthon used professional voice actors and original soundtracks. in may 2016, he announced that all titles would be remade by third-party companies for release on consoles.cawthon posted on his website in 2015 that he planned to publish his first novel (the silver eyes) in the near future, with its stories separate from that of the games. cawthon also announced that it would be co-written by author kira breed-wrisley. on june 20, 2016, scholastic announced that it would collaborate with cawthon on a multi-book deal. the silver eyes was released on december 17, 2015, on amazon kindle, and the paperback version was published on september 27, 2016, slightly earlier than its originally planned october publication date. a second novel, the twisted ones, was published on june 27, 2017, followed by the fourth closet on june 26, 2018.


== gameplay ==
the five nights at freddy's series consists of horror-themed video games in which the player is usually a night-time employee at a location connected with freddy fazbear's pizza, a fictional children's restaurant that takes inspiration from family pizza chains like chuck e. cheese and showbiz pizza place. the restaurant has life-size animatronic characters resembling anthropomorphic animals that perform on a show stage, usually for children's parties. the animatronics wander the restaurant at night, and the guard is instructed to watch over them. to progress through the games, the player must guard themselves against animatronics with a variety of tools. the original stated explanation for the animatronics' mobility is to prevent their servomotors from locking up due to lack of use, and their homicidal behaviors are caused by their mistaking humans for animatronic endoskeletons, whom they will force inside character suits, killing them in the process. from the third game forward, however, it is retroactively established that the animatronics are actually possessed by spirits of children murdered by restaurant cofounder and overarching franchise antagonist william afton, who stuffed the bodies inside the animatronics, then accidentally killed himself when he disguised himself in an animatronic suit and activated its spring-locks. this backstory is hinted at through a secret in the first game, where a hidden news article explains that the restaurant's reputation was damaged when blood, mucus, and foul odors began to leak from the animatronics' eyes and mouths.
in five nights at freddy's, the player can control the two security doors connecting their office to the adjacent hallways as a barrier against animatronics in the vicinity. each night, the player has a power supply that depletes faster when a tool is used. if the power goes out, the player can no longer use any tools and is defenseless against the animatronics unless a shift ends before main animatronic freddy fazbear can attack. five nights at freddy's 2 has different tools; there are no protective doors, and the player must instead use an empty animatronic head and flashlight to defend themself against the animatronics. the game introduced a music box which must be remotely wound up on a regular basis to prevent an attack from a particular animatronic. eight-bit mini-games were introduced, which are played randomly after death and give cryptic clues into the lore.five nights at freddy's 3 uses a monitor panel, which contains audio, camera, and ventilation. the player must keep certain systems from malfunctioning. these malfunctions can be triggered randomly or by the hallucinations of the animatronics from the first and second games. the ability to seal vents is also added and must be used to prevent the sole tangible animatronic from entering the office. the player can use an audio-based function on the cameras, which triggers a childlike voice to lure springtrap, the game's only physical animatronic possessed by william afton's spirit, away from the office. the 8-bit minigames return and are playable after each night if the player completes side tasks such as clicking on a poster or inputting a code into a wall. if the player completes the minigames, they unlock a secret ending.in five nights at freddy's 4, the gameplay occurs in a bedroom setting, and instead of being a nighttime security guard, the player takes the role of a small child who experiences nightmarish visions of the animatronics due to fearing their real-life counterparts. the player also no longer has access to a camera system. the player has four areas in the bedroom to monitor: two hallway doors on both sides of the room, the closet directly in front of them, and the bed behind them. at the doors, the player must listen for animatronics' breathing, which can determine whether they are near.if the player hears breathing at the side doors, they close the door and wait for the animatronics to walk away. if they open the doors too early, however, the animatronics jump scare the player. the player must also prevent small animatronics from accumulating on their bed, and prevent an animatronic from entering their closet. five nights at freddy's 4 also introduces a minigame involving a new animatronic, which offers the player a two-hour skip in the next night for completing the minigame.an elevated control pad is introduced for sister location, which can light a room or shock the animatronics. other mechanics include a second control pad in a breaker room, which controls power to the facility and a flash beacon, which allows the player to see in the dark funtime auditorium (a party room) and avoid its animatronic. sister location is the only game where the player can move between rooms.pizzeria simulator has business-style gameplay, and the player must spend in-game money to buy features for their pizzeria. a series of minigames can be played by testing the establishment's attractions. after the player has completed this portion of the game, they complete tasks in a room and fend off hostile, previously salvaged animatronics. the gameplay of pizzeria simulator shares a number of elements with five nights at freddy's 3, including the importance of ventilation and the ability to distract animatronics with sound.ultimate custom night is a customizable night, in which fifty animatronics are present and have a maximum ai level of twenty. the game includes many mechanics from the previous games, such as the heater, fan, music box, and power generator. the player can choose which characters they want active for a night, and how active the characters will be.
help wanted combines the gameplay of every other game, and turns into a virtual experience for the player. it also introduces several other minigames, in which the gameplay is variant, and also at times has free-roam. special delivery features location-based augmented reality gameplay. the player can switch on their camera, and the footage itself is the game's background. the animatronics will try to attack corresponding to the environment. the animatronics generally have cloaking, which leads them to being invisible.security breach holds the open-world aspect to this title allows players to experience a new level of immersion, similar to that of five night's at freddy's 4. players will also have access to a nifty tool called the faz-watch, which allows them to view maps, read messages picked up from random areas on the map, check security cameras for nearby danger, and look at their current objectives. it incorporates freddy as a helpful companion throughout the game, though he has limited power and must be charged at stations through the map. players can distract hostile animatronics by knocking things over to get their attention, while they can crouch and hide in various structures to evade them as they follow you throughout the map. unlike other five nights games there are limited save points and there is only a single save station after 6 a.m.


=== common elements ===


==== security cameras ====
in the first, second, third, seventh,a eighth,b and ninthc games, the player has a security-camera system, which observes the animatronic characters. one location can be viewed at a time, and some areas are not visible on the cameras. most camera feeds are dull, sometimes almost black and white in color, and full of video noise. in the third game, the cameras stop working if their associated system fails. cameras are used in the fifth game as a mechanic in the fake ending and custom night update, but not in the main game.


==== lights ====
in all games except for the third, lights are used to ward off animatronics or warn the player. lights in the first, second, fifth, and eighthb games are activated with buttons on the walls and illuminate the player's blind spots: the doorway or vent exit, respectively. the lights are similar in the fifth game, but are mounted on a control pad and illuminate the animatronics' rooms. the fifth game also introduced a flash beacon, which is used to orient the player in the third and fifth nights' pitch-black rooms.several games include use of a flashlight. in the second game, the flashlight has a finite battery life and cannot be recharged, while in the fourth and seventha games, the battery life is infinite. in the eighthb game, the flashlight battery varies depending on the game segment being played. flashlight battery life is again finite in the ninthc game, but can be recharged at various recharge stations throughout the game.


==== doors and vents ====
in the first, fourth, seventh,a eighth,b and ninthc games, doors are a means of defense for the player, and can be closed when an animatronic is near. vents are featured in the second, third, sixth, and eighthb games, as a medium through which animatronics can get to the player. both doors and vents are again present in the fake ending and custom night update of the fifth game with the same function. vents are also present in the fifth and ninthc games as means for the player to travel through, rather than the animatronics.


==== jump scares ====
every game in the main series contains jump scares, which end a game in defeat as the animatronics are implied to attack the player off-screen. in most jump scares, an animatronic character suddenly appears in the player's view, followed by a loud screaming or roaring noise. some jump scares, including those by golden freddy (in the first and seventha games), nightmare, and nightmarionette (in the fourth game), consist of a single screen with shrill, distorted audio; these jump scares usually crash (or restart) the game. the player must use various tools to prevent being attacked via jump scares and advance through each game.


==== minigames ====
in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth,b and ninthc games, the player gains access to a series of (predominantly eight-bit) minigames randomly after death, or after completing a specific task. the minigames usually relate to a story or event relevant to the game, in a cryptic manner. the minigames in the second game portray homicides mentioned by another worker of the restaurant, and the reason of the animatronics gaining life. the minigames in the third game show the story behind springtrap's creation. minigames in the fourth game tell the story of a character who dies in a tragic accident.there is only one minigame in the fifth game, which depicts the death of animatronic engineer william afton's daughter. the minigames in the sixth game depict various events in the series, all connected to afton. in the mobile version of the eighthb game, the player can access a minigame called "princess quest", which depicts the origins of a character called vanny; a recreation of these minigames is also featured in the ninthc game, with some significant additions.


== plot ==
the five nights at freddy's series mostly revolves around a chain of family restaurants under the ownership of fazbear entertainment, a company founded by henry emily and william afton. william is a robotics engineer known for creating a series of animatronic mascots to entertain customers, most prominently freddy fazbear, a brown bear and the namesake of freddy fazbear's pizza; bonnie, an indigo rabbit; chica, a yellow chicken; and foxy, a red pirate fox. additional animatronics featured throughout the series include the marionette; the ghostlike golden freddy; freddy's predecessor fredbear, the mascot of fredbear's family diner; and circus baby, the mascot of the restaurant's sister location, circus baby's pizza world. william is also a negligent father and child murderer who hides his victims' bodies inside his animatronic creations, where their souls inhabit the animatronics; he also specifically designs circus baby to be capable of murdering children, which leads to the accidental death of his own daughter, elizabeth (causing the shutdown of circus baby's pizza world). afton's direct murder victims start with his co-worker henry's daughter charlie and expand to include children visiting the restaurants with their families. meanwhile, a child (nicknamed the "crying child") is continuously bullied by his older brother, making him develop a fear of the animatronics. on the boy's birthday, the older brother and his friends forcibly shove him inside of fredbear's mouth, where his head is unintentionally crushed. at an unspecified point in the series timeline, william's son michael investigates circus baby's entertainment and rental, the underground facility where circus baby is kept, only to be forcibly "scooped" by baby, who has combined with other animatronics to form ennard, using michael's hollowed body as a host. however, michael's body gradually rots, and ennard is forced to eject itself out. michael is then apparently resurrected and begins searching for his father.
a while after the death of his victims, william is confronted by the ghosts of the children he murdered. seeking refuge from the ghosts, he hides inside an old yellow rabbit animatronic, spring bonnie. the suit's springlock mechanisms inside fail and snap shut, crushing william to death as his soul inhabits the animatronic, becoming springtrap. eventually, the restaurant chain shuts down. thirty years later, a horror attraction based on the restaurant chain known as fazbear's fright is constructed and springtrap is unearthed for it. before opening to the public, however, a fire destroys the attraction, which frees the souls of most of afton's victims and destroys the original mascots, though springtrap escapes. some time after the fire, henry lures michael, springtrap (now scraptrap), and all animatronics that weren't destroyed in fazbear's fright—including the marionette, ennard (now molten freddy), and the now-rebuilt baby (scrap baby)—into one single pizzeria. he then sets fire to the restaurant, destroying those inside and freeing all the children's souls. william, meanwhile, is trapped in eternal hell by the spirit of cassidy, one of the children he murdered.

==== five nights at freddy's 2 (2014) ====

shortly after the release of the first game, cawthon confirmed rumors about a sequel. he posted a teaser of the sequel on his website one month after the original game's release and continued to post teasers until the sequel's release. a trailer was released on october 21, 2014, introducing new animatronic characters and the absence of doors. five nights at freddy's 2 was released for microsoft windows on november 10, 2014, earlier than its planned release of december 25. ports for android and ios were released on november 13 and 20 of 2014, respectively. a windows phone port was also released, but was withdrawn for substandard graphics. playstation 4, xbox one, and nintendo switch console ports were released on november 29, 2019.the gameplay is largely similar to its predecessor. players must survive a night shift at the "new and improved" freddy fazbear's pizza restaurant from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m., without being attacked by any of the animatronics that wander from room to room. in addition to the animatronics from the first game, which are depicted in a deteriorated state, the game features several new antagonists, who can be fended off using different tactics. the explanation given for the animatronics' behavior during the game is similar to the one from the first five nights at freddy's. the protagonist is a new character, jeremy fitzgerald, who is promoted to daytime security after the sixth night, being replaced by fritz smith in the "custom night".
during the game, phone guy from the previous game calls jeremy to give him hints on how to survive each night while talking about the restaurant's history. during these calls, it is revealed that the restaurant has become the subject of a police investigation due to various rumors. it is also possible to access hidden atari-styled minigames that provide further insight on the restaurant's troubled past, showing a purple figure killing multiple children. on the fifth night, the location is put on lockdown due to an unspecified event. at the end of the game, jeremy receives a paycheck dated 1987, revealing that the events of the game take place before the first five nights at freddy's, and the restaurant is closed, with a new location set to be opened elsewhere.


==== five nights at freddy's 3 (2015) ====

on january 3, 2015, an image was uploaded to cawthon's website teasing a third entry in the series. other images followed before a trailer was released on january 26, 2015. on february 15, cawthon posted on steam that five nights at freddy's 3 was cancelled after a hacker allegedly leaked the game. this was later revealed as a hoax; the "leaked" download linked to a humorous clone of a previous game of cawthon's, there is no pause button!, in which the main character is depicted wearing the freddy animatronic head. five nights at freddy's 3 was released for microsoft windows on march 3, 2015, with android and ios ports following on march 7 and 12, respectively. playstation 4, xbox one, and nintendo switch console ports were released on november 29, 2019.set thirty years after the events of the first game, its main character works at fazbear's fright, a horror attraction based on the long-gone freddy fazbear's pizza. the player must defend themselves from the deteriorated animatronic-costume hybrid named springtrap. burnt and tattered hallucinations of some of the animatronics from the previous two games appear; and although they cannot kill the player, they can hinder ventilation, sound, and camera systems. failure to maintain the systems can create many issues for the player, including dysfunctional cameras and the inability to play audio to lure away the animatronic.the player receives guidance from a founder of the horror attraction for the first two nights and listens to old tape recordings which were found by the attraction's workers for the rest of the nights. the game has two endings: a "good" ending and a "bad" ending. the bad ending reveals that the souls of the murdered children still haunt the animatronics. the good ending is reached by completing secret minigames in which animatronic characters bring a cake to what seems to be a sorrowful child's soul. after completing the secret minigames, the souls of the children are freed.


==== five nights at freddy's 4 (2015) ====

on april 27, 2015, cawthon began posting images on his website teasing another game in the series, which was originally titled five nights at freddy's 4: the final chapter. a trailer was released on july 13, 2015, hinting that the game was set in the main character's house. five nights at freddy's 4 was announced with a release date of october 31, 2015. it was pushed forward to august 8 and again to july 23, when the game was unexpectedly released on microsoft windows through steam. android and ios ports were released on july 25 and august 3, 2015, respectively. playstation 4, xbox one, and nintendo switch console ports were released on november 29, 2019.the player character is an unknown and unnamed character who has delusions of being attacked by nightmarish versions of the first game's animatronic characters. the player must defend themselves with a flashlight and doors. the game's story is told through minigames, in which an unnamed young boy is bullied because of his irrational fear of a restaurant with a yellow animatronic bear and rabbit called fredbear and spring bonnie, respectively. he is guided by a plush version of fredbear, whom the boy imagines can speak to him when he is alone. the child appears to be ultimately killed by fredbear in a freak accident. the game had a halloween update with "nightmare" versions of animatronics from five nights at freddy's 2 and halloween-themed reskins for nightmare bonnie and nightmare chica.


==== five nights at freddy's: sister location (2016) ====

on april 23, 2016, cawthon posted a teaser image on his website of a clown-like animatronic named baby from an upcoming game titled sister location. several teaser images of different characters and hints at their origins followed. the trailer for the game was released on cawthon's youtube channel, with new animatronics and a new location. the release date was announced as october 7, 2016. cawthon made a prank release of the game on october 5, apparently releasing a "mature" edition after a decision to delay the game to make it more kid-friendly. the download link led to a clone of cawthon's previous game, sit 'n survive.sister location was released for microsoft windows on october 7, 2016, followed by ports for android on december 22, 2016, and ios on january 3, 2017, respectively. it was also released on nintendo switch in north america on june 18, 2020, and on xbox one on july 10, 2020. the playstation 4 port was released in europe and north america on july 21 and july 22, 2020, respectively.
the player character michael afton, nicknamed mike (jokingly called eggs benedict), is a new employee of circus baby's entertainment and rental (a sister company of fazbear entertainment that rents animatronics for children's parties). the animatronics were originally intended for circus baby's pizza world, which never opened due to a gas leak. mike is guided by handunit, an ai character similar to the phone guy of previous games. handunit instructs him about his job, often telling him to disregard safety; the animatronic baby often gives instructions that contradicts that of handunit, but are vital to survival.
the game also has a "custom night", in which the player can use mechanics reminiscent of the first game (such as interactive doors and a camera system) which were absent from the main game, except for a non-canonical ending, titled the "fake ending". new minigames are also available, describing michael's fate after the events of the main game. a cutscene is shown after the "golden freddy" custom-night preset, in which michael speaks to his father, william afton/springtrap, in a foreboding way.


==== freddy fazbear's pizzeria simulator (2017) ====

in june 2017, cawthon hinted at the development of a sixth main game in the series. on july 2, 2017, he announced his decision to cancel the game and said that he had been "neglecting other things in [his] life for the sake of trying to keep up with mounting expectations". on december 4, 2017, after teasing the game several days earlier, cawthon released freddy fazbear's pizzeria simulator as freeware on steam. the game is a business-simulation game in which the player runs a pizzeria, but frequently shifts into the survival-horror vein of the series' other games.
the game's story again follows michael afton who, sometime following the events of five nights at freddy's 3 and sister location, becomes the manager of a new freddy fazbear's restaurant run by the mysterious "cassette man". every night, michael, under cassette man's guidance, must salvage one of four decrepit animatronics that were found in the restaurant's back alley, including his father william / springtrap (now referred to as "scraptrap") and his sister elizabeth / circus baby (referred to as "scrap baby").
the game has multiple endings depending on how well the player runs the pizzeria and whether they salvaged all the animatronics, but the canon ending has cassette man reveal himself as henry emily, william's former business partner and the father of charlotte (the spirit possessing the puppet animatronic), and set the restaurant on fire after revealing its true purpose as a trap to lure in the remaining animatronics. the restaurant burns to the ground, seemingly killing michael, henry, and all the animatronics, finally releasing the spirits haunting them.


==== ultimate custom night (2018) ====

ultimate custom night was originally intended to be a post-launch add-on to pizzeria simulator, but was eventually turned into a stand-alone game, releasing on june 27, 2018. the customizable night contains a total of fifty animatronics from previous games, which allows the player to determine how aggressive they are during the night (similar to the custom nights in earlier games). the player can select the office to play in and has 16 themed game modes available. although unconfirmed, it has been heavily speculated that the game takes place in some version of hell or purgatory, where william afton, following his death in pizzeria simulator, is being continuously tortured by the vengeful spirit of one of his victims.
however, the anthology novel series fazbear frights implies that the game is actually afton's repeating nightmare, and not hell or purgatory. this comes from the fifth book, bunny call, which has a story called "the man in room 1280" where a burned man is kept alive by a shadow child despite the fact that he should be dead and suffers nightmares. in the following book, blackbird, the epilogue confirms that the man is actually william afton. although it was never confirmed if the fazbear frights series is set in the same continuity as the games, cawthon confirmed that it's supposed to reveal mysteries from the previous games.


==== five nights at freddy's: help wanted (2019) ====

on august 18, 2018, cawthon confirmed on his steam thread that the next main installment in the five nights at freddy's series would be available as a virtual reality game. on march 25, 2019, during sony interactive entertainment's state of play live stream announcing several new games for the playstation 4, a trailer announcing the game was shown. in the game, the player is a technician repairing a pizzeria's animatronics. from a first-person perspective, they fix the animatronics, solve puzzles and navigate dark hallways while avoiding malfunctioning and hostile animatronics. the game was released on may 28, 2019. a non-vr version of the game was released on december 17, 2019, for microsoft windows and playstation 4.

==== five nights at freddy's: security breach (2021) ====

on august 8, 2019, on the first game's fifth anniversary, cawthon posted a new image on his website, teasing the next installment for the series. it shows the "mega pizzaplex", a large shopping mall containing a laser tag arena, an arcade, a cinema and a freddy fazbear's pizza restaurant; in the main square, '80s-style versions of freddy, chica, and four completely new animatronics can be seen playing for an excited crowd. on april 21, 2020, the characters' names were leaked from funko's list of upcoming products, and the title was revealed as five nights at freddy's: pizza plex. scott cawthon confirmed the leaks via reddit but revealed that the title was not official. the game was initially scheduled for an early 2021 release, but was delayed to late 2021.security breach was released on playstation 5, playstation 4 and steam on december 16, 2021. the game's plot revolves around a young boy named gregory being trapped in a large shopping mall teeming with murderous animatronics who hunt him down by the orders of vanny, a mysterious woman in a rabbit costume, while also evading the mall's security guard, vanessa. suffering a malfunction that causes him to ignore vanny's hacking, freddy assists gregory in escaping the mall.
