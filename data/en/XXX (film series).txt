=== the final chapter: the death of xander cage (2005) ===
included with the 2005 director's cut dvd of the first film is a four-minute short titled the final chapter: the death of xander cage, that serves as a prequel to xxx: state of the union by detailing the alleged death of xander cage before the events of that film.
in the short film, xander is played by vin diesel's stunt double khristian lupo (who never shows his face or speaks) while reusing some archival lines spoken by diesel. it also features leila arcieri as jordan king from the first film and john g. connolly as lt. colonel alabama "bama" cobb, one of the villains from xxx: state of the union who is deckert's right-hand man, as the man behind the attack on xander.
the sequence opens with xander driving in a car with jordan king. he stops next to his apartment building. king makes sexual overtures to him and they get intimate. suddenly they hear a noise and xander goes to check it out. cobb's men show up and abduct king. they plant a bomb in the building and drop her coat on the steps to trick xander to his death. after confronting a homeless man, xander returns to the building. he takes the bait left by cobb and his henchmen and is apparently blown apart by a huge explosion. his trademark coat survives the blast. cobb shows up and picks up a piece of burnt skin from xander's neck which has the triple x tattoo on it. he remarks "poor xander, you never had very much between the ears." his men pick him up and drive off in their car. cobb's motives for killing xander are obvious; he doesn't want him to interfere in deckert's plans. "feuer frei" by rammstein plays in the background during the sequence.

=== critical and public response ===
the first film received mixed reviews from critics. roger ebert called it "as good as a james bond movie". adam smith of empire magazine called the movie, "sporadically entertaining, but seriously hampered by a very choppy screenplay", and rating it three out of five stars. the film was nominated for a razzie award for most flatulent teen-targeted movie, but lost to jackass: the movie.
the second film in the series was panned by critics, boo allen of the denton record chronicle called it "a chubby, surly, incomprehensible action hero".
brian orndorf of filmjerk.com compared watching the film to running "headfirst at top speed into a brick wall". 
david hiltbrand of the philadelphia inquirer said "the plot swings between pathetically implausible and aggressively stupid".
some critics liked the film. owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly called it "that rare b movie that's rooted in gut-level stirrings of power and retaliation". paul arendt of the bbc said, "viewed on its own trashy terms, it succeeds brilliantly".the third film received mixed reviews from critics. dan jolin of empire magazine said, "we've seen all these stunts pulled before, and seen them done better, but there's some pleasure to be had here â€” even if it's of the extremely guilty kind.", and rating it three out of five stars. andrew lapin of uproxx gave the film a negative review, saying: "there is an intellectual argument to be made in favor of the fast & furious franchise, which features diverse casts, operatic plotlines, and cartoon setpieces that often look like a child assembled them out of hot wheels sets. xxx is aiming for a much lower bar, striving only to be marketable, not inventive. the series is no longer interested in aping james bond, lacking as it does a decent gadget or supervillain and often highlighting the sidekicks at the expense of xander himself."


== video games ==
