yrf spy universe is an indian media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of spy action films, which feature various fictional raw agents. the films are produced and distributed by yash raj films.


== overview ==
the shared universe, which initially started out as a single movie series for the tiger films, later was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.the first film ek tha tiger (2012) and its sequel tiger zinda hai (2017) centre on a fictional raw agent played by salman khan. war (2019) tells the story of a raw agent played by hrithik roshan who goes rogue. before making war, producer aditya chopra and director siddharth anand came up with the idea of merging these films and creating a shared universe by crossing over the characters who all belong to the raw. however, war was still made as a standalone film without directly connecting to the first two tiger films—supporting the idea of creating a proper foundation for the war characters before a proper crossover.
pathaan (2023) starring shah rukh khan as the titular character and a raw agent, directed by anand, is the first film to have characters appearing from both the tiger franchise and war. it is the fourth film in the spy universe and the first yrf film to have a crossover.tiger 3 (2023) starring salman khan is the fifth film in the yrf spy universe, directed by maneesh sharma. it is the sequel to tiger zinda hai (2017). it was released on 12 november 2023 on diwali.
