on 26 march 2015, saudi arabia, leading a coalition of nine countries from west asia and north africa, launched an intervention in yemen following a request from yemeni president abdrabbuh mansur hadi for military support after his forces were ousted from sanaʽa by houthi insurgents during the yemeni civil war. government forces, houthi rebels, and other armed groups fought after the draft constitution and power-sharing arrangements collapsed, despite progress made by the un during the political transition at that time. violence escalated in mid-2014. houthis and allied insurgents seized control of sana'a in september 2014 and thereafter. in response, president hadi asked saudi arabia to intervene against the iranian-backed houthis.
the intervention, code-named operation decisive storm (arabic: عملية عاصفة الحزم, romanized: amaliyyat 'āṣifat al-ḥazm), initially consisted of a bombing campaign on houthi rebels and later a naval blockade and the deployment of ground forces into yemen. the coalition attacked the positions of the houthi militia and loyalists of the former president of yemen, ali abdullah saleh, who are supported by iran (see iran–saudi arabia proxy conflict). fighter jets & ground forces from egypt, morocco, jordan, sudan, the united arab emirates, oman helped provide medical service. kuwait, qatar, bahrain, and constellis (formerly called blackwater) headed the operation. djibouti, eritrea, and somalia made their airspace, territorial waters, and military bases available to the coalition.the united states provided intelligence and logistical support, such as aerial refueling and search-and-rescue for downed coalition pilots. it accelerated the sale of weapons to coalition states and continued strikes against aqap. the saudi foreign minister said that us & british military officials were in the command and control centre responsible for saudi-led air strikes in yemen, having access to lists of targets but were not involved in choosing targets.the intervention received widespread criticism and had a dramatic worsening effect on yemen's humanitarian situation, that reached the level of a "humanitarian disaster" or "humanitarian catastrophe". the question of whether or not the intervention is in compliance with article 2(4) of the un charter has been the matter of academic dispute. the conflict's status was described a "military stalemate" in 2019. the global covid-19 pandemic is said to have given saudi arabia an opportunity to review its interests in yemen. in early 2020, it was said that saudi arabia was searching for an exit strategy, amid the covid-19 pandemic and military defeats. on 29 march 2022, the saudi-led coalition announced that it would cease all hostilities within yemen starting at 6 a.m. the following day, in order to facilitate political talks & peacekeeping efforts.


== background ==

saudi-backed abdrabbuh mansur hadi, running unopposed as the only candidate for president, won the 2012 yemeni elections. since august 2014, the houthis (or ansar allah), a zaidi shia movement and militant group backed by iran, dissatisfied with hadi government's decisions and the new constitution, arranged mass protests which culminated into their takeover of the yemeni government in 2015, declaring victory of the revolution and drafting a new constitution when the term of hadi's provisional government had already expired. saudi arabia and other countries denounced this as an unconstitutional coup d'état. the houthis were supported by sections of the yemeni armed forces loyal to the former president ali abdullah saleh, who was removed from power as part of the 2011 arab spring uprisings and ironically assassinated later on by his houthi allies.by september 2014, houthi fighters captured sanaʽa, toppling hadi's government. soon after, a peace deal (known as the 'peace and partnership agreement') was sealed between the hadi government and the houthis, but was not honored by either party. the deal was drafted with the intent of defining a power-sharing government. a conflict over a draft constitution resulted in the houthis consolidating control over the yemeni capital in january 2015. after resigning from his post alongside his prime minister and remaining under virtual house arrest for one month, hadi fled to aden in southern yemen in february. upon arriving in aden, hadi withdrew his resignation, saying that the actions of the houthis from september 2014 had amounted to a "coup" against him. by 25 march, forces answering to sanaʽa were rapidly closing in on aden, which hadi had declared to be yemen's temporary capital.during the houthis' southern offensive, saudi arabia began a military buildup on its border with yemen. in response, a houthi commander boasted that his troops would counterattack against any saudi aggression and would not stop until they had taken riyadh, the saudi capital.on 25 march, hadi called on the un security council to authorise "willing countries that wish to help yemen to provide immediate support for the legitimate authority by all means and measures to protect yemen and deter the houthi aggression".yemen's foreign minister, riad yassin, requested military assistance from the arab league on 25 march, amid reports that hadi had fled his provisional capital. on 26 march, saudi state tv station al-ekhbariya tv reported that hadi arrived at a riyadh airbase and was met by saudi defense minister mohammad bin salman al saud. his route from aden to riyadh was not immediately known.at a summit of the arab league held in sharm el-sheikh, egypt, on 28–29 march, president hadi again repeated his calls for international intervention in the fighting. a number of league members pledged their support to hadi's government during that meeting.after more than seven years of hostilities that left thousands of civilians dead or injured and devastated yemen, a surprise deal was agreed between regional rivals saudi arabia and iran in march 2023. the deal aimed to restore diplomatic relations that could end the saudi war in yemen. experts raised a warning that the war could worsen instead of ending, if saudi arabia agrees to end military operations.


== operation decisive storm ==
according to the saudi news outlet al arabiya, saudi arabia contributed 100 warplanes and 150,000 soldiers to the military operation. several media agencies reported that planes from egypt, morocco, jordan, sudan, kuwait, the united arab emirates, qatar and bahrain were taking part. egypt had previously sent four warships supporting the saudi naval blockade.the operation was declared over on 21 april 2015.

"the indiscriminate bombing of populated areas, with or without prior warning, is a contravention international humanitarian law," he said. he continued to say that he was particularly concerned about airstrikes on saada "where scores of civilians were reportedly killed and thousands were forced to flee their homes after the coalition declared the entire governate a military target".

"with the hospital destroyed, at least 200,000 people now have no access to lifesaving medical care," msf said. "this attack is another illustration of a complete disregard for civilians in yemen, where bombings have become a daily routine," said hassan boucenine, msf head of mission in yemen. the gps coordinates of the only hospital in the haydan district were regularly shared with the saudi-led coalition, and the roof of the facility was clearly identified with the msf logo, he said. unicef said the hospital in saada was the 39th health center hit in yemen since march, when the violence escalated. "more children in yemen may well die from a lack of medicines and healthcare than from bullets and bombs," its executive director anthony lake said in a statement. he added that critical shortages of fuel, medication, electricity and water could mean many more will close. amnesty international said the strike may amount to a war crime and called for an independent investigation.in february 2016, the saudis bombed the ancient citadel of kawkaban, killing seven civilians.on 8 october 2016, saudi-led airstrikes targeted a hall in sanaʽa where a funeral was taking place. at least 140 people were killed and about 600 were wounded. according to the independent, one rescuer said: "the place has been turned into a lake of blood." after initially denying it was behind the attack, the coalition's joint incidents assessment team admitted that it had bombed the hall but claimed that this attack had been a mistake caused by bad information. after this attack, us national security spokesperson said that the us government was "deeply disturbed" by the bombing and added that us support for the saudi-led coalition was "not a blank cheque". he added "we have initiated an immediate review of our already significantly reduced support to the saudi-led coalition." the united nations humanitarian co-ordinator in yemen jamie mcgoldrick said he was "shocked and outraged" by the "horrific" bombing.

== reports of war crimes ==

the saudi-led campaign has received widespread criticism and had a dramatic worsening effect on the humanitarian situation in yemen, that reached the level of a "humanitarian disaster" or "humanitarian catastrophe". the war has contributed to the famine in yemen which has threatened over 17 million people, according to the un, as well as an outbreak of cholera which has infected hundreds of thousands.after the saudi-led coalition declared the entire saada governorate a military target in may 2015, the un's humanitarian coordinator for yemen and human rights watch expressed concern that the bombing there was unnecessarily harming civilians. on 1 july 2015, the un declared for yemen a "level-three" emergency—the highest un emergency level—for a period of six months. human rights groups repeatedly blamed the saudi-led military coalition for killing civilians and destroying health centres and other infrastructure with airstrikes.
in june 2015, aid agencies said the de facto blockade of yemen had dramatically worsened the humanitarian situation, with 78% (20 million) of the population in urgent need of food, water and medical aid. aid ships are allowed, but the bulk of commercial shipping, on which the country relies, is blocked. in one incident, coalition jets prevented an iranian red crescent plane from landing by bombing sanaʽa international airport's runway, which blocked aid delivery by air.according to farea al-muslim, direct war crimes were committed during the conflict; for example, an idp (internally displaced person) camp was hit by a saudi airstrike, while houthis sometimes prevented aid workers from giving aid. the un and human rights groups discussed the possibility that war crimes may have been committed by saudi arabia during the air campaign.us representative ted lieu has criticized the saudi-led attacks on yemen: "some of these strikes look like war crimes to me, and i want to get answers as to why the us appears to be assisting in the execution of war crimes in yemen."in march 2017, human rights watch (hrw) reported that "since the start of the current conflict, at least 4,773 civilians had been killed and 8,272 wounded, the majority by coalition airstrikes.... human rights watch has documented 62 apparently unlawful coalition airstrikes, some of which may amount to war crimes, that have killed nearly 900 civilians, and documented seven indiscriminate attacks by houthi-saleh forces in aden and taizz that killed 139 people, including at least eight children."in an april 2020 report, human rights watch said that war crimes committed by saudi arabia and united arab emirates in yemen go unmentioned. they stated that these countries were responsible for most child casualties and illegal attacks on schools. on december third, 2020, more than 60 organizations urged the u.n. general assembly  to establish an investigative body to gather and preserve evidence of serious human rights violations during yemen's seven-year conflict, including possible war crimes and crimes against humanity.on 20 december 2021, the saudi-led coalition carried out air raids at the international airport in the yemeni capital, sanaa. as a result of these airstrikes, un aid flights into sanaa were halted as the airport was no longer able to receive aircraft operated by the united nations or international humanitarian organisations. since 2016, humanitarian flights into sanaa airport have been largely interrupted by a saudi-led blockade.according to a report by relief web, released on 13 december 2022,  the houthis along with the saudi/uae-led coalition have used explosive weapons in densely populated areas of yemen throughout the duration of the conflict. the report details at least ten such incidents of civilian harm caused by attacks carried out by the saudi/uae-led coalition and the houthis.on august 21, 2023 the washington post reported that saudi security forces killed hundreds of ethiopian migrants and asylum seekers attempting to cross the country’s border with yemen, according to human rights watch. the saudis allegedly shot at people at close range and fired explosive weapons at groups in the mountains, in what could amount to crimes against humanity.


=== attacks on facilities run by aid organizations ===
since the saudi-led coalition began military operations against ansar allah on 26 march 2015, saudi-led coalition airstrikes unlawfully struck hospitals and other facilities run by aid organizations, according to human rights watch. médecins sans frontières (msf) medical facilities in yemen were attacked four times in three months. on 26 october 2015, hrw documented six saudi-led airstrikes which bombed a msf hospital in haydan district (sa'dah governorate), wounding two patients.  msf's director of operations raquel ayora said: "the way war is being waged in yemen is causing enormous suffering and shows that the warring parties do not recognise or respect the protected status of hospitals and medical facilities. we witness the devastating consequences of this on people trapped in conflict zones on a daily basis. nothing has been spared—not even hospitals, even though medical facilities are explicitly protected by international humanitarian law."

on 16 may 2016, brigadier general ahmed hassan asiri responded to human rights watch's accusations, stating that saudi arabia's actions are not motivated by self-interest, but rather "because we saw population undermined and oppressed by the militias". ahmed asiri claimed that human rights watch did not have a team on the ground in yemen, and when told by mary louise kelly during an interview that human rights watch had visited yemen, stated "no. no one can get in yemen without the permission of the coalition".human rights watch responded to these statements on 16 may 2016. belkis wille stated that "in fact, this two-week trip was the fourth i had made to yemen since the beginning of the war in march 2015. given what i go through to get into yemen, al-assiri's statement was laughable". she stated that on each of her visits to yemen during this time period her passport has been confiscated, with no reason being given. she claims that this indicates that the coalition knows that she is visiting yemen.after initially denying responsibility, on 15 october 2016, saudi arabia admitted responsibility for the funeral airstrikes which killed at least 140 and injured 525. saudi arabian forces blamed the airstrikes on "wrong information" which was provided by an unnamed party, which had reportedly claimed the funeral was a legitimate target. human rights watch has claimed that the airstrikes likely constitute a war crime, due to the indiscriminate nature of the attack.

== foreign support and funding ==

in march 2015, president barack obama declared that he had authorized us forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the saudis in their military intervention in yemen. deputy secretary of state antony blinken said that "as part of that effort, we have expedited weapons deliveries, we have increased our intelligence sharing, and we have established a joint coordination planning cell in the saudi operation centre."nato powers such as the united kingdom and the united states support the saudi arabian–led intervention in yemen primarily through arms sales and technical assistance. france had also made recent military sales to saudi arabia. msf emergency coordinator karline kleijer called the us, france and the uk part of the saudi-led coalition, which imposed the weapons embargo and blocked all ships from entering yemen with supplies. rights groups have criticized the countries for supplying arms, and accuse the coalition of using cluster munitions, which are banned in most countries. oxfam pointed out that germany, iran, and russia have also reportedly sold arms to the conflicting forces. tariq riebl, head of programmes in yemen for oxfam, said, "it's difficult to argue that a weapon sold to saudi arabia would not in some way be used in yemen," or "if it's not used in yemen it enables the country to use other weapons in yemen." amnesty international urged the us and the uk to stop supplying arms to saudi arabia and to the saudi-led coalition. on august 3, 2019, a united nations report said the us, uk and france may be complicit in committing war crimes in yemen by selling weapons and providing support to the saudi-led coalition which it accused of using starvation of civilians as a tactic of warfare.in 2016, the united states government sold 1.3 billion dollars of arms to saudi arabia despite concerns from officials that it could be complicit in war crimes through its support for the saudi arabian-led coalition in yemen. u.s. government lawyers were unable to conclude whether the u.s. support for the coalition made them a co-belligerents under international law.arms sale by united kingdom to saudi arabia and the united arab emirates in 2019 reportedly soared by £1bn, i.e. 300%, in comparison to the figures in 2018. andrew smith of the campaign against arms trade condemned the increase and criticized the uk arms industry of being dominated by human rights abusers and dictatorships. uk-made fighter jets have been accused of causing catastrophic damage in yemen. according to official figures released by the department for international trade (dit), the united kingdom has exported £11bn worth of arms in 2019, becoming the second-highest arms exporter after the united states. the uk traded arms despite a june 2019 court ruling halting the sale of weapons to saudi arabia that could be used in yemen.in january 2020, the state department told lawmakers that it was planning to permit raytheon to sell precision-guided missiles worth $478 million to saudi arabia and expand its manufacturing inside the country, despite the kingdom's human rights record and objections by both democratic and republican lawmakers. on february 4, 2021, the new us president joe biden announced an end to the u.s. support for saudi-led operations in yemen. however, u.s. arms sales have continued.in early june 2020, the french government published a report on the arms exports of 2019, where the sale of €1.4 billion arms was made to saudi arabia. human rights watch urged the french authorities to halt any arms sale to saudi, considering the country is accused in possible war crimes and human rights abuses in yemen. in july 2020, amnesty international revealed that france had promoted a private military center to train saudi troops and backed it both financially and politically. according to the report, france intended to train the saudi soldiers in the operations of the latest versions of weapons that had already been used in the yemeni conflict. the training center has been set up at the town of commercy in meuse with funds extracted from the french taxpayer's money, violating international treaties, as per lebel.in september 2020, a united nations panel listed canada among the countries who contributed to fueling the war in yemen. following that, 39 human rights organizations, arms-control groups and labor unions, including the public service alliance of canada, sent a joint letter to the canadian prime minister justin trudeau, urging for the country to end arms exports to saudi arabia.the saudi-led coalition used a precision-guided munition developed in the united states in an air hit on a detention facility in sa'adah, northwestern yemen, that killed at least 80 people and injured over 200, according to doctors without borders. the laser-guided bomb used in the raid was made by raytheon, a us defence company.following a spate of missile assaults by yemeni rebels, the us will deploy a guided-missile destroyer and cutting-edge fighter jets to help defend the united arab emirates, according to a us statement released wednesday, february 2, 2022.the commander of us central command arrived in the united arab emirates on sunday, february 6, 2022, to expand on previous pentagon announcements to assist the uae in bolstering its defenses following attacks in yemen by iranian-backed rebels.in a june 2022 joint analysis, the washington post in association with security force monitor at columbia law school's human rights institute (sfm) reported that the united states supported the majority of the saudi-led coalition's airforce squadrons. a large portion of the coalition airstrikes were carried out by aircraft developed, maintained and sold by u.s. companies, and were flown by pilots trained by the u.s. military. out of the 39 air force units of the coalition that could have conducted airstrikes, 38 likely benefited by u.s. approved contracts and in the seven years since the beginning of the bombing campaign, the u.s. approved 213, out of the 902 total contracts, that potentially served the coalition's airforce units.on 7 june 2022, an internal report from the government accountability office (gao) was released which concluded that the united states' state department and the defense department had failed to properly assess war crimes allegations against the saudi-led coalition and had not adequately tracked civilians deaths caused by american-made weapons. the report concluded that there were serious gaps in u.s. government oversight on how arms sold to saudi arabia and the uae were used.yemeni citizen, ayman mohammed saleh al-sanabani filed a lawsuit against saudi arabia and the uae, the us state department, the us department of defense, raytheon, lockheed martin and general dynamics, alleging them of human rights abuses in yemen. in an opinion article on the guardian in march 2023, he said his family, including his bride, were massacred on his wedding day in a missile attack by saudi and the uae in october 2015. ayman mohamed also accused the us of the tragedy and war crimes in yemen. he said the us and its defense contractors of complicity in the humanitarian crisis in yemen. he also called on the joe biden to fulfill his campaign promise and stop the arms sales to saudi arabia.


== operation costs ==
in december 2015, david ottaway, a senior scholar at the wilson center in washington, estimated the saudi-led military coalition was spending $200 million a day on military operations in yemen. his sources speculate that the saudis are supplying most of the funding.on 20 october 2020, state secretariat for economic affairs (seco) published a report that swiss companies exported war material to the value of almost 690 million francs. according to this report saudi arabia, currently involved in a conflict in yemen bought war material from switzerland for 3.8 million francs.

== al-qaeda and islamic state ==

both al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula (aqap) and islamic state had a presence in yemen before the saudi-led intervention. aqap had controlled substantial pieces of territory for some time, while islamic state claimed for twin bombings in sanaa the following month that killed 140 people and injured hundreds more.the two radical groups have used the conflict to expand and consolidate, an obvious fact accepted by the pentagon. the houthis disengaged fighting aqap to face rival yemeni militias at the same time as they were being hit by coalition air strikes; a source indicates that yemeni troops in the south remained in their bases instead of confronting al-qaeda militants, fearing saudi air strikes on any troop movements. there are questions about the ability of the country to confront its islamist militancy problem due to the major infrastructure damage caused by the war.within weeks of the commencement of the yemen's civil war, aqap had exploited the chaos to capture the south-eastern port city of mukalla, along with nearby military, transport, and economic infrastructure. a series of prison breaks by al-qaeda—they emptied mukalla's jail of 300 prisoners and emptied 1,200 inmates in june 2015 from the central prison in taiz—released jailed jihadists of all ranks. reports indicate that yemen's prisons had, in preceding years, reportedly become "de facto jihadi academies", as veteran militants were placed in cells alongside young, regular criminals.the coalition campaign against the houthis in yemen's city of aden in july 2015 and subsequent chaos increased aqap and islamic state presence in the city. residents of aden faced a wave of bombings and shootings that prevented efforts at stabilization. aqap conducted assassinations of judges, security officials, and police.on 26 august 2015, bob semple, a british petroleum engineer who was kidnapped and held as a hostage by al qaeda in yemen was freed by the uae armed forces after 18 months of captivity.at the start of february 2016, aqap recaptured azzan, an important commercial city in shabwa province. a few weeks later, al-qaeda fighters and saudi-led coalition forces were seen fighting a common target; the houthis.
but the situation is different in aden, the aqap/isis and pro-hadi that were fighting a common enemy in taiz are enemies in aden. on 29 february 2016, a suicide car killed 4 pro-hadi troops in shiek othman district in aden, the city that hadi uses as a temporary capital.the united arab emirates has spearheaded an active role against fighting aqap and isil-yp presence in yemen through a partnership with the united states. in april 2016, uae armed forces assisted yemeni forces in retaking the city of mukalla from aqap during the battle of mukalla. in august 2017, the uae armed forces assisted a yemeni army offensive against aqap in shabwah governorate.in an op-ed in the washington post yousef al otaiba, the uae ambassador to the united states, described that the intervention has reduced aqap presence in yemen to its weakest point since 2012 with many areas previously under their control liberated. the ambassador declared that more than 2,000 militants have been removed from the battlefield, with their controlled areas now having improved security and a better delivered humanitarian and development assistance such as to the port city of mukalla and other liberated areas. an associated press investigation outlined that the military coalition in yemen actively reduced aqap in yemen without military intervention, instead by offering them deals and even actively recruiting them in the coalition because "they are considered as exceptional fighters". uae brigadier general musallam al rashidi responded to the accusations by stating that al qaeda cannot be reasoned with and cited that multiple of his soldiers have been killed by them. the uae military stated that accusations of allowing aqap to leave with cash contradicts their primary objective of depriving aqap of its financial strength. the notion of the coalition recruiting or paying aqap has been thoroughly denied by the united states pentagon with colonel robert manning, spokesperson of the pentagon, calling the news source "patently false". the governor of hadramut faraj al-bahsani, dismissed the accusations that al qaeda has joined with the coalition rank, explaining that if they did there would be sleeper cells and that he would be "the first one to be killed". according to the independent, aqap activity on social media as well as the number of terror attacks conducted by them has decreased since the emirati intervention.in january 2019, cnn stated that saudi arabia and the uae provided al-qaeda linked groups in yemen with us-made military equipment including vehicles.on 25 june 2019, saudi special forces announced that they captured the leader of the isil-yp, abu osama al-muhajer, on the 3 june along with other members including the chief financial officer of the organization.in april 2020, yemeni journalist salah bin laghbar revealed documents showing cooperation between saudi-led coalition and al-qaeda in yemen; "an official document from the al-humiqani tribe warns saudi-led coalition against sending weapons to terrorist organizations through the al-rashad party, muslim brotherhood and terrorist abdul rahman abu al-harith al-humiqani, who is affiliated with daesh."

on 8 september 2015, vice news revealed a leaked email by un envoy to yemen ismail ould cheikh ahmed. in it, the envoy confirms that houthi rebels and the party of former president and houthi ally ali abdullah saleh have expressed willingness to accept—with some reservations—a un security council resolution, approved in april. this demanded the rebels "withdraw their forces from all areas they have seized, including the capital, sanaa". "aa/gpc agreed to a new wording on unsc resolution 2216 that states unequivocally that they are committed to the implementation of 2216 (see document attached) with the exception of article which infringe on yemeni sovereignty and those related to sanctions," wrote ould cheikh ahmed, referring to ansar allah (aa)—another name for the houthis—and saleh's general people's congress party (gpc). "in addition, the new text includes acceptance of the return of the current government for a period of 60 days during which a government of national unity shall be formed," wrote the envoy in the email. according to ould cheikh ahmed, during talks, the houthis gave ground on certain language, including "mandatory support by the international community for reconstruction that was in the earlier version". "the latter was particularly opposed by ksa kingdom of saudi arabia and gcc gulf cooperation council who did not want it to be interpreted as a form of mandatory compensation," added the un envoy.on 10 september, un envoy to yemen announced that all parties had agreed to peace talks. a statement from hadi's office following a meeting on the issue of new talks affirmed the president's "complete support for the sincere efforts exerted by the special envoy". it urged ahmed to "exert efforts to achieve the public and honest commitment on the part of the houthis and saleh" to implement 14 april council resolution unconditionally. on 13 september, the exiled yemeni government announced that it would no longer participate in the peace talks.

on 18 april, peace talks aimed at ending yemen's civil war that were set to begin faltered before they could start, when delegates representing yemen's houthi rebels refused to attend.on 20 april, talks convened, based on un security council resolution 2216 which called for the houthi fighters to withdraw from areas they seized since 2014 and hand heavy weapons back to the government.on 6 august, the un special envoy to yemen, ismail ould cheikh ahmed, announced the suspension in kuwait, where the talks were being held. he said that the negotiations were not a failure and that they would resume in a month at an undisclosed location. mr. ahmed is the second united nations envoy to try to broker peace talks between the houthis and other factions in yemen since march 2015. his predecessor quit after similar peace talk efforts failed. after the breakdown of the talks, one of the houthi negotiators, nasser bagazgooz, blamed the united nations envoy for seeking what he said amounted to a military solution on behalf of the saudi-led coalition. previous negotiations floated the idea of forming a unity government—composed of houthi and former hadi government leaders. but the exiled hadi leaders have consistently rejected any deal that would diminish their power over yemen, and the houthis have said that they will reject any deal that does not give them a seat at the table.
