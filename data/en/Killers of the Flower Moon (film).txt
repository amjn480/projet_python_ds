== plot ==
osage nation elders bury a ceremonial pipe, mourning their descendants' assimilation into white anglo-saxon protestant american society. wandering through their oklahoma reservation, which features the annual "flower moon" phenomenon of fields of blooms, several osage find oil gushing from the ground. the tribe becomes wealthy, as it retains mineral rights and members share in oil-lease revenues, though law requires white court-appointed legal guardians to manage the money of full and half-blood members, assuming them "incompetent".in 1919, ernest burkhart returns from world war i to live with his brother byron and uncle william king hale on hale's large reservation ranch. hale, a reserve deputy sheriff/cattle rancher popularly called "king", poses as a friendly benefactor of the osage, speaking their language and bestowing gifts. he suggests that ernest court mollie kyle, an osage whose family owns oil headrights. ernest, who alongside byron has been committing armed robbery against the osage, meets mollie via his day job as a cab driver. a romance develops, and the two marry in a ceremony mixing roman catholic and osage traditions. over time, they raise three children.
hale secretly orders the contract killings of multiple wealthy osage. he explains that ernest will inherit more headrights if more of mollie's family dies. mollie is diabetic, and her mother lizzie is ill. after mollie's sister minnie dies of a mysterious illness, hale orders byron to kill mollie's other sister, the rebellious anna. lizzie and the osage council blame the reservation's white residents and urge the tribe to fight back.
a newsreel of the 1921 tulsa race massacre, in which white people destroyed a black community and killed numerous residents, causes further concern amongst the osage that they could suffer similarly. lizzie sees her ancestors welcome her to the afterlife as she dies. hale orders ernest to murder henry roan, mollie's first husband, to collect on his life insurance. however, ernest botches the assassination and hale brutally paddles him inside a masonic temple as punishment.
hale is the local political boss, and both the local sheriff and judges are in his pocket; so no investigations are made. an osage nation representative seeking to lobby congress is murdered in washington, d.c. mollie discreetly hires private detective william j. burns, but ernest and byron beat him and run him off of the reservation.
hale orders ernest to murder reta, mollie's last remaining sister, and her husband by having criminal acie kirby blow up her house. mollie inherits all her family's headrights. despite her illness, mollie travels to washington with an osage delegation and asks president calvin coolidge for help. because of this, hale orders ernest to poison mollie's insulin with heroin to "slow her down". mollie's condition worsens, and ernest sometimes uses the heroin himself from shame. 
due to mollie's lobbying, the bureau of investigation (boi) sends agent thomas bruce white sr. and assistants to investigate; they quickly find out the truth. hale tries to cover his tracks by whacking his own hitmen, including acie, but special agent white arrests hale and ernest. the agents find mollie severely ill and get her proper medical care.
special agent white persuades ernest burckhardt to confess and turn state's evidence against his uncle. w. s. hamilton, hale's attorney, tries to convince ernest to claim he was tortured and recant. however, after one of his and mollie's daughters dies of whooping cough, ernest testifies against his uncle. hale unsuccessfully tries to have his nephew murdered. mollie meets with ernest after he testifies, but decides to leave him after he refuses to admit to poisoning her.
a radio show later reveals the aftermath. ernest burckhardt and william hale were convicted and both received life sentences. both were paroled after years of incarceration, despite osage protests to the parole board. byron served no prison time due to a hung jury. the shoun brothers, who gave ernest the heroin for mollie and were implicated in other "wasting deaths", were never prosecuted due to lack of evidence. after the trial, mollie divorced ernest, married john cobb, and died of diabetes in 1937 at the age of 50. she was buried with her parents, sisters and daughter. her obituary did not mention the osage murders. a 21st century osage powwow with a large dancing circle is later shown.

== themes ==
the analysis of the themes in the book and film has centered on the difference between killers of the flower moon and traditional westerns in the old hollywood tradition. in its review of the film, jorge cotte of the nation stated: "unlike the visions of unbounded freedom found in traditional westerns, martin scorsese's new film is a study of a west bounded by the vertical geometry of oil rigs and the violent conspiracies of powerful men." cotte then indicated the thematic differences between the book version and the film version of scorsese's film stating: "at the center of grann's book is a set of unsolved crimes: a slew of unsolved murders, then called the 'reign of terror', that tormented the osage from 1921 to 1926, and the corresponding emergence of a bureau of investigation (the eventual fbi) that finally arrives to determine who is doing the murdering. the book is meticulously researched and as diligent in setting the context for these shocking acts as it is in examining j. edgar hoover's role in shaping the bureau and using the murders as a showcase for it... scorsese's retelling ends up being narrower in focus. it does away with much of the original's sense of suspense and hoover's role in the investigation, and instead focuses on how an individual descends, through greed, complicity, and cowardice, into unforgivable acts of despoliation and violence."

=== critical response ===
on the review aggregator website rotten tomatoes, 93% of 435 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.5/10. the website's consensus reads: "enormous in runtime, theme, and achievement, killers of the flower moon is a sobering appraisal of america's relationship with indigenous peoples and yet another artistic zenith for martin scorsese and his collaborators." metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 89 out of 100, based on 63 critics, indicating "universal acclaim". audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of "aâˆ’" on an a+ to f scale, while those polled by posttrak gave it an 88% overall positive score, with 72% saying they would definitely recommend the film.in his review of the "meaty and demanding" film following its premiere at cannes, peter debruge of variety commended the story, characters and themes, but criticized the runtime: "in its present form, [killers of the flower moon] is still a compelling true story ... it's engrossing from the get-go, the palpable tension methodically echoed by robbie robertson's steady-heartbeat score. but it keeps going and going until everyone we care about is dead, dying or behind bars, with nearly an hour still in store". conversely, david rooney of the hollywood reporter opined, "the three-and-a-half-hour running time is fully justified in an escalating tragedy that never loosens its grip" and praised the screenplay, direction, cinematography, score, and cast performances (particularly that of gladstone).in the guardian, peter bradshaw called the film an "epic of creeping, existential horror about the birth of the american century, a macabre tale of quasi-genocidal serial killings" and also lauded the "performance of tragic force" by gladstone. the los angeles times' justin chang observed that the film "is both like and unlike anything its director has ever done", writing "scorsese doesn't just achieve a sense of place; he also pulls off, not for the first time, a passionate and meticulous feat of cultural anthropology. he brings an entire bygone era to rich, teeming life, just before he chokes it off with an all-consuming stench of death."the film's coda in particular drew acclaim for its acknowledgement of the historical silencing of crimes committed against indigenous peoples, with joel robinson of slate writing the scene "turns the camera both inward and onto the audience simultaneously", and the new yorker's richard brody noting, "scorsese's control of form and tone, and the bold yet subtle way that he marshals incident, signal that he is intent not merely on narrating history but on troubling the conscience of his (doubtless largely white) audience".much praise was given to lily gladstone's performance, with anthony lane of the new yorker describing her as "unmistakably the movie's most compelling presence", and justin chang calling her "an actor who can set off more emotional reverberations with a barely cracked smile than some performers manage in an entire monologue". richard brody observed, "[mollie] is not only the character on whose actions the drama pivots but also the one whose subjectivity, presented sparingly but suggested powerfully, gives the story a sense of inner life."some critics lamented the film's decision to focus its narrative on the characters of ernest and hale, opining that the character of mollie felt underdeveloped. chang noted "the movie seems curiously reluctant to penetrate the psychology of its osage characters â€” a reluctance that feels like timidity, respect or maybe a mix of both." angelica jade bastiÃ©n of vulture wrote, "trapped by the gleam of reverence, [scorsese] ends up returning to the same racial stereotypes he sought to avoid: the osage people are noble and connected to the land, but their personalities, their desires, their joys, and, most crucially, their anger remain in the shadowed hallways of a history scorsese is too timid to approach."

=== indigenous response ===
at the film's la premiere, christopher cote, an osage who was a language consultant for the film, said that he "really wanted this to be from the perspective of mollie and what her family experienced". slate's joel robinson, an osage, expressed similar views, but still praised the film, concurring with former chief of the osage nation jim gray that he had "never seen a film immerse itself in a culture like this one did with ours." he added that he hoped that the success of the film would mean more opportunities for indigenous filmmakers to tell stories from their own point of view. maureen lee lenker notes in entertainment weekly that first nations actress devery jacobs, elora danan postoak on reservation dogs, shared her reaction to the film: "being native, watching this movie was f---ing [sic] hellfire. ... our pride[,] languages, cultures, joy & love are way more interesting & humanizing than showing the horrors white men inflicted on us."; jacobs also believes gladstone "carried mollie [with] tremendous grace", and that though no performances were weak, "each of the osage characters felt painfully underwritten, while the white men were given way more courtesy and depth.'" indigenous commentator kate nelson wrote, "when it comes to native representation, is killers of the flower moon perfect? no. is it progress? yes. the film meaningfully moves the entertainment industry forward, making a strong statement that it's no longer acceptable to extract valuable assets from indigenous communities â€“ whether that be our stories or our natural resources â€“ without our consent and input."on november 9, 2023, the day that the sag-aftra strike ended, gladstone posted on social media encouraging native people to "see it when and only if you feel ready, and see it with people you feel safe with. you'll likely have a lot of generational grief to process."


=== legislative responses ===
lieutenant governor of oklahoma matt pinnell named the film as a reason to increase subsidies for the film industry in oklahoma. the filmed in oklahoma act of 2021 allocated $30 million to film subsidies. bills to increase the total available subsidies to $80 million in 2023 failed in the oklahoma senate after passing the oklahoma house of representatives.
