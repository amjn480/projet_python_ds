O, or o, is the fifteenth letter and the fourth vowel letter in the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English is o (pronounced ), plural oes.


== History ==
Its graphic form has remained fairly constant from Phoenician times until today. The name of the Phoenician letter was
 øeyn, meaning "eye", and indeed its shape originates simply as a drawing of a human eye (possibly inspired by the corresponding Egyptian hieroglyph, cf. Proto-Sinaitic script).
Its original sound value was that of a consonant, probably [ ï], the sound represented by the cognate Arabic letter ÿπ  øayn.The use of this Phoenician letter for a vowel sound is due to the early Greek alphabets, which adopted the letter as O "omicron" to represent the vowel /o/. The letter was adopted with this value in the Old Italic alphabets, including the early Latin alphabet. In Greek, a variation of the form later came to distinguish this long sound (Omega, meaning "large O") from the short o (Omicron, meaning "small o"). Greek omicron gave rise to the corresponding Cyrillic letter O and the early Italic letter to runic ·õü.

The letter ‚ü®o‚ü© is the fourth most common letter in the English alphabet. Like the other English vowel letters, it has associated "long" and "short" pronunciations. The "long" ‚ü®o‚ü© as in boat is actually most often a diphthong  (realized dialectically anywhere from [o] to […ô ä]). In English there is also a "short" ‚ü®o‚ü© as in fox, , which sounds slightly different in different dialects. In most dialects of British English, it is either an open-mid back rounded vowel […î] or an open back rounded vowel […í]; in American English, it is most commonly an unrounded back […ë] to a central vowel [a].Common digraphs include ‚ü®oo‚ü©, which represents either  or ; ‚ü®oi‚ü© or ‚ü®oy‚ü©, which typically represents the diphthong , and ‚ü®ao‚ü©, ‚ü®oe‚ü©, and ‚ü®ou‚ü© which represent a variety of pronunciations depending on context and etymology.In other contexts, especially before a letter with a minim, ‚ü®o‚ü© may represent the sound , as in 'son' or 'love'. It can also represent the semivowel  as in choir or quinoa.In English, the letter ‚ü®o‚ü© in isolation before a noun, usually capitalized, marks the vocative case, as in the titles to O Canada or O Captain! My Captain! or certain verses of the Bible.


=== Other languages ===
‚ü®o‚ü© is commonly associated with the open-mid back rounded vowel […î], mid back rounded vowel [oÃû] or close-mid back rounded vowel [o] in many languages. Other languages use ‚ü®o‚ü© for various values, usually back vowels which are at least partly open. Derived letters such as ‚ü®√∂‚ü© and ‚ü®√∏‚ü© have been created for the alphabets of some languages to distinguish values that were not present in Latin and Greek, particularly rounded front vowels.


=== Other systems ===
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, ‚ü®o‚ü© represents the close-mid back rounded vowel.

0 (zero). The capital letter O may be mistaken or misused for the number 0, as they appear quite identical in some typefaces. Early typewriters did not have a 'zero' key: users were actually expected to use capital O.
