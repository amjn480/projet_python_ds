The 2024 UEFA European Football Championship, commonly referred to as UEFA Euro 2024 (stylised as UEFA EURO 2024) or simply Euro 2024, will be the 17th edition of the UEFA European Championship, the quadrennial international football championship organised by UEFA for the men's national teams of its member associations. Germany will host the tournament, which is scheduled to take place from 14 June to 14 July 2024.
It will be the third time that European Championship matches are played on German territory and the second time in reunified Germany as the former West Germany hosted the tournament of 1988, and four matches of the multi-national Euro 2020 were played in Munich. It will be the first time the competition is held in what was formerly East Germany with Leipzig as a host city, as well as the first time that a reunified Germany served as a solo host nation. The tournament will return to its usual four-year cycle, after 2020 edition was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Italy are the defending champions, having won the 2020 tournament after beating England on penalties in the final.


== Host selection ==

On 8 March 2017, UEFA announced that only two countries, Germany and Turkey, had announced their intentions to host the tournament before the deadline of 3 March 2017.The host was selected on 27 September 2018 in Nyon, Switzerland. Germany initially planned to fully host Euro 2020 although never announced any firm interest by May 2012.
The UEFA Executive Committee voted for the host in a secret ballot, with only a simple majority required to determine the host. In the event of a tie, the UEFA President would cast the decisive vote. Of the 20 members of the Executive Committee, two were ineligible to vote and one was absent, leaving a total of seventeen voting members.


== Venues ==
Germany had a wide choice of stadiums that satisfied UEFA's minimum capacity requirement of 30,000 seats for European Championship matches.
Of the ten venues selected for Euro 2024, nine were used for the 2006 FIFA World Cup: Berlin, Dortmund, Munich, Cologne, Stuttgart, Hamburg, Leipzig, Frankfurt, and Gelsenkirchen. Düsseldorf, which was not used in 2006 but had previously been used for the 1974 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 1988, will serve as the tenth venue; conversely, Hanover, Nuremberg and Kaiserslautern, host cities in 2006 (in addition to 1974 and 1988 in Hanover's case), will not be used for this championship. Munich was also a host city at the multi-national UEFA Euro 2020 tournament, hosting four matches (three involving Germany) in front of a greatly reduced number of spectators due to COVID-19 restrictions.
Various other stadiums, such as those in Bremen and Mönchengladbach were not selected. The venues covered all the main regions of Germany, but the area with the highest number of venues at UEFA Euro 2024 is the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, with four of the ten host cities (Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Gelsenkirchen and Cologne).


== Teams ==


=== Qualification ===

As hosts, Germany qualified for the tournament automatically. The 23 remaining spots will be determined by a qualifying tournament; 20 spots were decided by the direct qualification of the winners and runners-up of the 10 qualifying groups, with the remaining three spots decided by play-offs. Places in the play-offs were given to the teams that performed the best in the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League who did not already qualify via the main qualifying tournament.The draw for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying group stage was held on 9 October 2022 at the Festhalle in Frankfurt. The qualifying group stage took place from March to November 2023, while the three play-offs will be held in March 2024.Of the 24 teams set to qualify for the tournament, 17 have returned from the previous edition; among them were World Cup runners-up France, defending champions Italy, who finished as runners-up to 2020 runners-up England in their qualifying group, Portugal who were the only team to finish with a flawless qualifying record, and Scotland, who qualified through their group for the first time since the 1998 World Cup.
Albania and Romania returned after missing out on the pan-continental finals, the former qualifying for only their second major tournament, whilst Serbia and Slovenia both returned for the first time in 24 years, with Serbia qualifying for the first time as an independent nation (having previously qualified for their last five European Championships as first Yugoslavia and then FR Yugoslavia) and Slovenia qualifying for only their fourth major tournament since securing independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, alongside their first tournament since the 2010 World Cup.
Sweden failed to reach the finals for the first time in 28 years and failed to qualify for their second major tournament in a row, having already missed qualification to the 2022 World Cup, whilst Russia were barred from the qualifiers altogether in the aftermath of the country's invasion of Ukraine, the first time a national team had been banned from the competition since FR Yugoslavia in 1992. Having played in the previous edition, North Macedonia did not qualify for the 2024 tournament.


==== Disqualification of Russia ====
At a meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in Hvar, Croatia, on 20 September 2022, it was confirmed that Russia would be excluded from qualifying for Euro 2024, all Russian teams having been suspended by UEFA following the country's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This meant Russia would not appear at the European Championship finals for the first time since 2000.


== Final draw ==
The final tournament draw will take place on 2 December 2023, 18:00 CET, at the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg. The teams will be seeded in accordance with the overall European Qualifiers rankings. Hosts Germany will be automatically seeded into pot 1, and placed in position A1. The three play-off winners will not be known at the time of the draw, and the teams participating in those play-offs, scheduled to be held in March 2024, will be placed into pot 4 for the draw.

=== Tiebreakers ===
If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria are applied:
Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;
Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question;
Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;
If, after having applied criteria 1 to 3, teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 3 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams who are still level to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 10 will apply;
Superior goal difference in all group matches;
Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;
If on the last round of the group stage, two teams are facing each other and each had the same number of points, as well as the same number of goals scored and conceded, and the score finished level in their match, their ranking is determined by a penalty shoot-out. (This criterion is not used if more than two teams had the same number of points.);
Lower disciplinary points total in all group matches (1 point for a single yellow card, 3 points for a red card as a consequence of two yellow cards, 3 points for a direct red card, 4 points for a yellow card followed by a direct red card);
Higher position in the European Qualifiers overall ranking, unless the comparison involves hosts Germany, in which case a drawing of lots will take place.Notes
