P, or p, is the sixteenth letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English is pee (pronounced ), plural pees.


== History ==
The Semitic P√™ (mouth), as well as the Greek Œ† or œÄ (Pi), and the Etruscan and Latin letters that developed from the former alphabet, all symbolized /p/, a voiceless bilabial plosive.


== Use in writing systems ==
In English orthography and most other European languages, ‚ü®p‚ü© represents the sound /p/.
A common digraph in English is ‚ü®ph‚ü©, which represents the sound , and can be used to transliterate ‚ü®œÜ‚ü© phi in loanwords from Greek. In German, the digraph ‚ü®pf‚ü© is common, representing a labial affricate /pf/.
Most English words beginning with ‚ü®p‚ü© are of foreign origin, primarily French, Latin and Greek; these languages preserve Proto-Indo-European initial *p.    Native English cognates of such words often start with ‚ü®f‚ü©, since English is a Germanic language and thus has undergone Grimm's law; a native English word with initial /p/ would reflect Proto-Indo-European initial *b, which is so rare that its existence as a phoneme is disputed.
However, native English words with non-initial ‚ü®p‚ü© are quite common; such words can come from either Kluge's law or the consonant cluster /sp/ (PIE *p has been preserved after s).
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, /p/ is used to represent the voiceless bilabial plosive.
P is the eighth least frequently used letter in the English language.
