== legacy and public image ==
following the launch of lizzie mcguire, duff received a significant amount of fame and media attention. the series proved to be a major hit for the network, and led to a string of merchandising that included lizzie mcguire dolls, video games, plush figures, and even mcdonald's happy meal toys. the success of the lizzie mcguire movie "indicated that duff's television fanbase could be migrated to film." following her success from lizzie mcguire, richard huff of the new york daily news called duff "a 2002 version of annette funicello" but admitted that the character of lizzie mcguire was both a blessing and burden for her. in 2003, huff stated that duff's public image is "tied" to lizzie mcguire. in 2005, katie long from the centre of parent/youth understanding wrote an analysis of duff and her suitability as an idol for young teens. duff, she wrote, "is not like britney spears or christina aguilera... yet" but remains "someone that adolescent girls can relate to."duff was credited with the revival of hollywood records following the release of metamorphosis (2003). the san fernando valley business journal wrote that the album was "giving hollywood records a needed shot in the arm" after a decline in cd sales during the previous two years had forced the label to reduce costs and alter its operation. hilliard lyons analyst jeffrey thomison cited metamorphosis as a reflection of disney's ability to develop "great synergy between their cable, film and music segments" duff's transition from disney star to successful singer became a formula that hollywood records tried to implement with future acts such as miley cyrus, selena gomez, demi lovato, and bridgit mendler among others. artists such as cyrus, gomez, lovato, and keke palmer have all cited duff as influences on their careers.
her song "come clean" (2003) was used as the theme song to the mtv reality series laguna beach, which is in turn credited with helping promote the song in the united states. her song "sweet sixteen" (2003) was used as the theme for the mtv reality series of the same name. multiple dates on her most wanted tour to promote hilary duff (2004) sold out in minutes. she sold over fifteen million albums by 2014.her transition from teenage star to adult actress has been praised by some critics, while her transition is often compared to the less successful transitions of her peers. in 2007, duff's appearance on the cover of maxim was accompanied by the declaration that she had gone "from the queen of teen to breakout sex symbol." following this, duff placed at #23 on the annual hot 100 women list compiled by maxim. she has remained on the list ever since in addition to being regularly listed on the annual fhm list of the 100 sexiest women (she peaked at no. 8 in 2008). the associated press wrote that this sudden provocativeness was representative of "a clear move [on duff's part] to put her lizzie mcguire past behind her", and that more provocative imaging of her would help her singles to garner mainstream radio play: "ultimately, nature, time and genetics may help duff in a way disney, despite all its might, cannot." however, despite "the fact that she is grown up," duff "has managed to maintain her sweet persona," wrote young hollywood.following the birth of her son in 2012, duff said that it took her a year for her to lose her baby weight and that she lost nearly 50 pounds by 2013. duff stated that she revamped her diet and hired a personal trainer. duff's slow but healthy method in shedding off her post-pregnancy weight was praised by health experts and was looked up to by actress tia mowry, who cited duff as her idol in taking up a healthy and safer way to lose the excess weight gained during pregnancy. duff has credited her weight loss success to a balanced lifestyle and the practice of flexible "macro counting" or iifym (if it fits your macros) because it makes for allowances in indulgences such as bread and chocolate.
