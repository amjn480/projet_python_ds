=== cleveland cavaliers (2003–2010) ===


==== 2003–2004: rookie of the year ====
james was selected by his hometown team, the cleveland cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 nba draft. in his first regular season game, he scored 25 points in a 106–92 loss to the sacramento kings, setting an nba record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance. at the conclusion of the 2003–2004 season, he became the first cavalier to receive the nba rookie of the year award. with final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game, he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie. cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.


==== 2004–2008: rise to superstardom ====
in the 2004–2005 season, james earned his first nba all-star game selection, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the eastern conference. around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, and denver nuggets coach george karl told sports illustrated: "it's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... he's the exception to almost every rule." on march 20, james scored 56 points against the toronto raptors, setting cleveland's new single-game points record. with final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first all-nba team. despite a 30–20 record to start the year, the cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42–40.
at the 2006 all-star game, james led the east to victory with 29 points and was named the nba all-star game most valuable player. behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game, he also finished second in overall nba most valuable player award voting to steve nash. under james's leadership, the cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998. in his postseason debut, james recorded a triple-double in a winning effort versus the washington wizards. in game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, making another in game 5. cleveland would go on to defeat the wizards before being ousted by the detroit pistons in the second round.
in the 2006–2007 season, james's averages declined to 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.6 steals per game. some analysts attributed the fall to a regression in his passing skills and shot selection, which stemmed from a lack of effort and focus. the cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the east's second seed. in game 5 of the eastern conference finals, james logged 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, scoring 29 of cleveland's last 30 points, including the game-winning layup with two seconds left, in a 109–107 double-overtime victory against the pistons. after the game, play-by-play announcer marv albert called the performance "one of the greatest moments in postseason history" and color commentator steve kerr described it as "jordan-esque". in 2012, espn ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern nba playoff history. the cavaliers went on to win game 6 and claim their first-ever eastern conference championship, earning them a matchup with the san antonio spurs in the finals. during the finals, james struggled, averaging 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting, as cleveland was eliminated in a sweep.in february of the 2007–2008 season, james was named all-star game mvp for the second time behind a 27-point, 8-rebound, and 9-assist performance. on march 21, he moved past brad daugherty as the cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the raptors, doing so in over 100 less games than daugherty. his 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, marking his first scoring title. despite his individual accomplishments, cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45–37. seeded fourth in the east entering the playoffs, the cavaliers defeated the wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion boston celtics in the next round. during the decisive seventh game in boston, james scored 45 points and paul pierce scored 41 in a game the associated press described as a "shootout".


==== 2008–2010: mvp seasons ====
at the conclusion of the 2008–2009 season, james finished second in nba defensive player of the year award voting and made his first nba all-defensive team, posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks. he also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season. behind his play and the acquisition of all-star guard mo williams, cleveland went a franchise record 66–16 and fell just one game short of matching the best home record in league history. with final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, james became the first cavalier to win the mvp award. reflecting on james's performance for espn, john hollinger later wrote: "he's having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time we gave him his due for it."in the playoffs, cleveland swept the pistons and the atlanta hawks to earn a matchup with the orlando magic in the conference finals. in game 1 of the series, james scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the cavaliers. in game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1–1. cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in game 6, james immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike. for the series, he averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8 assists per game, finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.in february of the 2009–2010 season, james was forced into a temporary point guard role following a series of injuries to players in the cavaliers' backcourt. behind his leadership, cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season. due in part to his increased minutes as the cavaliers' primary ball handler, james increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another mvp award. to open the playoffs, cleveland advanced past the bulls to earn a matchup with the celtics in the second round. james was heavily criticized for not playing well in game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points. the team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, james walked off the court to a smattering of boos from cleveland's home crowd. the cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in game 6, with james posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists, and 9 turnovers in the losing effort.


=== miami heat (2010–2014) ===


==== the decision ====

james became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 am edt on july 1, 2010. during this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the bulls, los angeles clippers, miami heat, new york knicks, new jersey nets, and cavaliers. on july 8, he announced on a live espn special titled the decision that he would sign with the heat. the telecast was broadcast from the boys & girls club of greenwich, connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. an additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. the day before the special, fellow free agents chris bosh and dwyane wade also announced that they would sign with miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. james decided to join with bosh and wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an nba championship than had he stayed in cleveland. heat president pat riley played a major role in selling james on the idea of playing with bosh and wade. james would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since oscar robertson to average a triple-double in a season.upon leaving the cavaliers, james drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players. the decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. many thought that the prolonged wait for james's choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show. upon learning that james would not be returning to cleveland, cavaliers owner dan gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced james's actions. some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey. former nba players, including michael jordan and magic johnson, were also critical of james, condemning him for joining with bosh and wade in miami and not trying to win a championship as "the man". james drew further criticism in a september interview with cnn when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from the decision. as a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, he quickly gained a reputation as one of america's most disliked athletes, which was a radical change from prior years. the phrase "taking my talents to south beach" became a punch line for critics. in retrospect, james has expressed some regret over his handling of the decision.


==== 2010–2011: year of media and fan scrutiny ====
james officially signed with the heat on july 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal which sent two second- and two first-round draft picks to the cavaliers and gave the team the option to swap first round picks with the heat in 2012. as part of the first player-created nba superteam he became only the third reigning mvp to change teams and the first since moses malone in 1982. that evening, the heat threw a welcome party for their new "big three" at the american airlines arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere. during the gathering, james predicted a dynasty for the heat and alluded to multiple championships. outside of miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of james.throughout the 2010–11 season, the media and opposing fanbases treated james and the heat as villains. to begin the year, they struggled to adjust to these new circumstances, going only 9–8 after 17 games. james later admitted that the constant negativity surrounding the team made him play with an angrier demeanor than in years past. on december 2, james faced the cavaliers in cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent. he scored 38 points and led miami to a win while being booed every time he touched the ball. the heat eventually turned their season around and finished as the east's second seed, with james averaging 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7 assists per game on 51 percent shooting.in the conference semifinals, james and his teammates found themselves matched up with the celtics for the second consecutive year. in game 5, he scored miami's last ten points to help seal a series-clinching win. after the final buzzer, he famously knelt on the court in an emotional moment, later telling reporters that it was an extremely personal victory for him and the team. the heat eventually advanced to the finals, where they were defeated by the dallas mavericks in six games. james received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series and scored just eight points in game 4, a game miami lost by just three. his finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.


==== 2011–2013: back-to-back championships ====
the 2011–2012 season was delayed by a lockout, and during that extended summer, james worked with hakeem olajuwon in order to improve his post up game. humbled by the heat's loss to the mavericks, the experience inspired james to leave behind the villain role that he had been embracing, which helped him regain a sense of joy on the court. behind james's expanded skillset, miami began the year with a franchise-best 18–6 record. he was eventually named mvp for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting.
in the second round of the playoffs, miami temporarily lost bosh to an abdominal injury and found themselves trailing the indiana pacers 2–1. james responded with a 40-point, 18-rebound, and 9-assist outing in game 4 to help even the series. to compensate for bosh's absence, the heat embraced a small-ball lineup with james at power forward, which they retained even after bosh's return in the conference finals against the celtics. facing elimination in game 6, james recorded 45 points and 15 rebounds to lead the heat to victory in what the new york times called a "career-defining performance". miami won game 7 to advance to the finals, earning them a matchup with the oklahoma city thunder and james's budding rival kevin durant. late in game 4 of the series, james hit a three-pointer to give the heat a lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps. in game 5, he registered a triple-double as miami defeated oklahoma city for their second-ever championship and james's first championship. james was unanimously voted the bill russell nba finals most valuable player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game. his full postseason run, in which he averaged 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game, was later ranked the second best in modern nba history by espn.in february of the 2012–13 season, james averaged 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records. that same month, the heat also began a 27-game winning streak, which is the third longest in nba history. based on these accomplishments, james's performance was described as a "month for the ages" by sports illustrated. miami eventually finished the year with a franchise and league best 66–16 record, and james was named mvp for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in nba history to win the award unanimously. his final season averages were 26.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.in game 1 of the conference finals, james scored a buzzer-beating layup to give miami a one-point victory against the pacers. throughout the series, his supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted him to compare his responsibilities to those of his "cleveland days". despite these struggles, the heat advanced to the finals for a meeting with the spurs, signifying a rematch for james from his first finals six years earlier. at the beginning of the series, he was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as miami fell behind 2–3. in game 6, he recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the heat to a comeback victory. in game 7, he tied the finals record for most points scored in a game 7 victory, leading miami over san antonio with 37 points. he was named finals mvp for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round.

==== 2016–2018: end of second stint in cleveland ====
the 2016–2017 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the cavaliers; james later described it as one of the "strangest" years of his career. following a january defeat to the new orleans pelicans, he publicly criticized cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too "top heavy", for which he received countercriticism. the cavaliers finished the season as the east's second seed, with james averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game. in game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the pacers, leading cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in nba playoff history. in game 5 of the conference finals against the celtics, james scored 35 points and surpassed michael jordan as the league's all-time postseason scoring leader. the cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to the finals for the third consecutive time against the warriors, who had signed james's rival kevin durant during the off-season. behind averages of 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game, james became the first player to average a triple-double in the finals, but cleveland was defeated in five games.

on june 29, 2018, james opted out of his contract with the cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent. on july 1, his management company, klutch sports, announced that he would sign with the los angeles lakers; the deal was officially completed on july 9. in an interview with sports illustrated, james's agent rich paul explained: "in 2010, when he went to miami, it was about championships. in 2014, when he went back to cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. in 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do." reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that los angeles was not his optimal destination.the lakers expected james to immediately transform them into a championship contender after having missed the playoffs since 2014 and not appearing in the finals since 2010. following his signing, the team rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans. to begin the 2018–19 season, they struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games. in november, they began a turnaround, which included two of james's strongest performances of the season. on november 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the portland trail blazers. on november 18, he scored a season-high 51 points in a win over the heat. after blowing out the warriors on christmas day, los angeles improved their record to 20–14, but james suffered a groin injury, the first major injury of his career. he missed a then career-high 17 consecutive games, and the lakers fell out of playoff contention without him, marking the first time that james missed the playoffs since 2005. in march, the lakers announced that james would begin a minutes restriction, and he was later officially ruled out for the remainder of the season. james's final averages were 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game. despite his inconsistent campaign, james was named to the all-nba third team, marking the first time in twelve years that he did not make the all-nba first team.

== national team career ==
james made his debut for the united states national team at the 2004 olympics in athens, greece. he spent the games mostly on the bench, averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games. team usa finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first u.s. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding active nba players to their lineup. james felt his limited playing time was a "lowlight" and believed he was not given "a fair opportunity to play".at the 2006 fiba world championship in japan, james took on a greater role for team usa, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain. the team finished the tournament with an 8–1 record, winning another bronze medal. james's behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate bruce bowen, who confronted james during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.before naming james to the 2008 olympic team, team usa managing director jerry colangelo and coach mike krzyzewski gave james an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice. at the fiba americas championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an american in an olympic qualifier. team usa went 10–0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 olympics in beijing, china. james credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: "i don't think we understood what it meant to put on a usa uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. we definitely know that now." at the olympics, team usa went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000. in the final game, james turned in 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists against spain.james did not play at the 2010 fiba world championship but rejoined team usa for the 2012 olympics in london, england. he became the leader of the team, with bryant, who would soon be 34, stepping back. james facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed. during a game against australia, he recorded the first triple-double in u.s. olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists. team usa went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating spain in the final game. james contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in u.s. men's basketball history. he also joined michael jordan as the only players to win an nba mvp award, nba championship, nba finals mvp, and olympic gold medal in the same year. afterwards, krzyzewski said: "[james] is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now."


== player profile ==
standing 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) tall and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg), james has played the majority of his career at the small forward and power forward positions, but he has also been deployed at the other positions when necessary. his playing style, which is athletic and versatile, has drawn comparisons to basketball hall of famers oscar robertson, magic johnson, and michael jordan. through the 2022–23 season, james's career averages are 27.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.3 assists, 1.5 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game. throughout the 2010s, he was usually ranked as the best player in the nba each season by espn and sports illustrated.


=== offense ===
as an 18-year-old rookie, james led the cavaliers in scoring. he holds numerous "youngest to" distinctions, including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points. during his first stint in cleveland, he was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented, he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball. his combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because he was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones. these qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets. around this time, james was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game. teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by spurs coach gregg popovich in the 2007 finals, where james converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.in miami, heat coach erik spoelstra changed james's role to a more unconventional one. james spent more time in the post and improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots. he also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the heat's "pass-happy" offense. behind these improvements, james's overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels. during this time, espn's tom haberstroh called james's free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as "average". upon returning to the cavaliers, james began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity, posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016. his shooting also temporarily regressed, and he briefly ranked as the nba's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint. despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.for most of his career, james has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team. his playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in nba history. by exploiting his size, vision, and the attention he garners from opposing defenses, james creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists. he executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic. his uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force nba teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent james from passing to open shooters. early in james's career, he was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games; however, as his career progressed, james's clutch performance was viewed more favorably.


=== defense ===
at the beginning of james's nba career, he was considered a poor defensive player, but he improved steadily through the years. in 2009, he became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block the shot. in miami, he developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the heat relied on him to guard all five positions. along with shane battier and dwyane wade, miami used james in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme, with james cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position. beginning in 2014, some analysts reported a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines. during his second stint in cleveland, his defense progressively declined. after missed drives on offense, he often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; he provided less help off the ball, and was less aggressive in switching. james himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as "chill mode". he eventually developed a reputation for raising his defensive level in the playoffs, which some analysts referred to as "playoff lebron".


== legacy ==
james left high school as one of the most hyped prospects in nba history. upon entering the nba, he made an immediate impact and was voted rookie of the year in his debut season. as of may 2023, he has been named to 19 all-nba teams, including 13 times to the first team, which are both nba records. his four mvp awards are matched only by michael jordan, kareem abdul-jabbar, wilt chamberlain, and bill russell; james and russell are the only players to win four mvp awards in a five-year span. james has also won four finals mvp awards, which is the second-most all-time, and earned all-defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014. while james has never won the defensive player of the year award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals. his teams have appeared in the finals ten times and won four championships; his ten finals appearances are tied for third all-time. some analysts have criticized him for not having a better finals record, while others have countered that james usually performed well but his team was defeated by superior competition.on the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included james in rankings of the best basketball players in history, and he was named the associated press male athlete of the decade for the 2010s. in addition to praising james's on-court accomplishments, analysts have also noted james's influence on player empowerment throughout the nba, which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. ben golliver of the washington post opined that james's move to the heat in 2010 "defined a decade of player movement", and that he "fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations." james's fellow players have also remarked on his influence, such as warriors forward draymond green, who reflected: "we've taken control of our destiny. and i think a lot of people hate that ... . i think the doors that he's opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment."james is also discussed within the context of being the greatest basketball player of all time, which has resulted in frequent comparisons to michael jordan. in a 2016 interview with sports illustrated, james acknowledged that his motivation was surpassing jordan as the greatest. in february 2018, the ringer spent an entire week devoted to both players, with bill simmons ultimately concluding that jordan was still ahead. in polls, james has ranked second behind jordan. the results strongly correlate with age, with older voters more commonly choosing jordan. davis et al. of business insider stated: "the data would suggest that younger, more-engaged nba fans lean toward james, as he's still playing. older generations who watched jordan play and tune in less today lean toward jordan." referring to james as the best challenger to jordan's status as the greatest basketball player of all time, sam quinn of cbs sports stated that "the margin for error where jordan is involved is overwhelmingly slim" and that "in the rings-obsessed basketball discourse", jordan having more titles and an "unblemished finals record holds significant weight".james has voiced his desire to play basketball into his forties, potentially alongside or against his sons bronny and bryce.

=== public image ===
since 2015, james has been considered by fellow nba players, media tabloids, and popular culture, to be the "face of the nba" alongside two-time mvp stephen curry. james' opinions have yielded significant influence on people who make important league decisions; in 2014, he asked commissioner adam silver to increase the duration of the all-star break, and the request was granted the following season. on february 13, 2015, james was elected the first vice president of the national basketball players association (nbpa).

throughout his career, james has been ranked by forbes as one of the world's most influential athletes, and in 2017, he was listed by time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. during his first stint with the cavaliers, he was adored by local fans, and sherwin-williams displayed a giant nike-produced banner of james on its world headquarters. despite their affection for james, cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he sported a yankees hat when he attended cleveland indians baseball games versus the new york yankees. following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and the decision, he was listed as one of the most disliked athletes in the united states. by 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by espn as the most popular player in the nba for the second time in his career. in 2014, he was named the most popular male athlete in america by the harris poll. he has led the league in jersey sales six times.memorabilia associated with james is highly sought after; two of james's rookie cards are among the most expensive basketball cards ever sold at auction, and one of those cards also briefly held the record for the most expensive modern-day sports card when it sold for $1.8 million at auction in july 2020. a mike trout rookie card broke the record for a modern-day card the following month. all jerseys worn in the 2020 nba all-star game were auctioned by the nba and nbpa to raise funds for charity; james's jersey sold for $630,000, setting a record for a modern-day sports jersey.in march 2008, james became the first black man, as well as the third man overall after richard gere and george clooney, to appear on the cover of vogue, when he posed with gisele bündchen. in response, espn columnist jemele hill considered the cover offensive and "memorable for the wrong reasons", describing the demeanor of james and his holding bündchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster king kong, a dark savage capturing his fair-skinned love interest.

=== charities ===
james is an active supporter of non-profit organizations, including after-school all-stars, boys & girls clubs of america, and children's defense fund. he also has his own charity foundation, the lebron james family foundation, which is based in akron. since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon to raise money for various causes. in 2015, james announced a partnership with the university of akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021. in 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the smithsonian national museum of african american history and culture to support an exhibit on muhammad ali. in 2017, he received the j. walter kennedy citizenship award from the nba for his "outstanding service and dedication to the community."in november of that same year, the akron school board approved the i promise school, a public elementary school created in a partnership with the lebron james family foundation to help struggling elementary school students stay in school. james later reflected that it was his most important professional accomplishment of his life. the school officially opened on july 30, 2018.


=== politics ===

throughout his career, james has taken stances on controversial issues. on several occasions, he mentioned a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status. those include the war in darfur, the killing of trayvon martin, the now-former nba owner donald sterling's racist comments in 2014, the michael brown verdict, and the death of eric garner. following a racist incident at his los angeles home in 2017, james expressed that "being black in america is tough. we got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as african americans until we feel equal in america." later on that year, in the aftermath of the unite the right rally, james questioned the "make america great again" slogan and said: "it's sad what's going on in charlottesville. is this the direction our country is heading? make america great again huh? our youth deserve better!!" james also called trump a "bum" after the president rescinded a white house invitation to stephen curry. during a 2018 interview with cnn journalist don lemon, james accused trump of attempting to divide the country with sports, suggesting that "sports has never been something that divides people it's always been something that brings someone together." he declared that he would "never sit across from him. i'd sit across from barack [obama] though." in response, trump tweeted: "lebron james was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, don lemon. he made lebron look smart, which isn't easy to do." james has supported colin kaepernick in the aftermath of his participation in the u.s. national anthem kneeling protests, saying that he was being blackballed from a new contract in the national football league and he would hire him if he owned a football team. he has worn his clothing in a show of support several times.in june 2008, james donated $20,000 to a committee in support of obama for the 2008 u.s. presidential election. later that year, james gathered almost 20,000 people at the then-called quicken loans arena for a viewing of obama's 30-minute american stories, american solutions television advertisement. the advertisement was shown on a large screen above the stage, where jay-z later held a free concert. in november 2016, james endorsed and campaigned for hillary clinton for the 2016 u.s. presidential election.during the 2019–2020 hong kong protests, a statement james made about a since-deleted tweet by daryl morey, in which morey expressed support for the pro-democracy movement in hong kong, became the subject of controversy. james said morey was "misinformed". his statement drew backlash from protesters in the movement. in february 2022, political commentator bill maher called james hypocritical for not taking a critical stance towards the chinese government's human rights abuses. james has taken various other stands on issues regarding sports, such as the kaepernick controversy and the houston astros sign stealing scandal.
