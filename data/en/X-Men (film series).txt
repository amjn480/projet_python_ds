== television ==


=== legion (2017–2019) ===

after completing work on the first season of fargo at fx in 2014, noah hawley was presented with the opportunity to develop the first live-action television series based on the x-men comics, of which he was a fan when growing up. hawley was initially pitched two different ideas for the potential series, including an adaptation of the comics' hellfire club, but the ideas did not interest hawley. instead, he worked with x-men film series writer and producer simon kinberg to reverse-engineer an idea for the series, set in alternate continuity to that of the film series. after discussing an "interesting show in this genre ... that isn't being done", the two settled on the character of david haller / legion. hawley found the character interesting because of his mental illness, and for the potential of the series to depict his unique mindset. he pitched the series as "a deconstruction of a villain ... and a love story".in october 2015, fx ordered a pilot for legion, with marvel television and fx productions producing; fx productions would handle the physical production. hawley was set to write the pilot, and executive produce the series alongside x-men film producers lauren shuler donner, bryan singer, and kinberg, marvel television executives jeph loeb and jim chory, and hawley's fargo collaborator john cameron. steve blackman, alan fine, stan lee, joe quesada, and karim zreik also executive produce. hawley's initial script for the series was described as "less fractured", "cohesive [and] much more regular." however, he quickly reconceived the series "and decided more eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, terrence malick, more whimsy, more impressionistic and went in that direction." by january 2016, fx president john landgraf was confident that the series would be picked up by the network, saying that "the vast majority of things that we pilot do go forward to series" and "the scripts [for legion] are extraordinary." that may, fx ordered an eight-episode first season of legion, starring dan stevens as the title character, alongside rachel keller, aubrey plaza, jean smart, jeremie harris, amber midthunder, katie aselton, bill irwin, jemaine clement, and hamish linklater, with navid negahban and lauren tsai respectively joining the cast in the second and third seasons.in january 2016, landgraf stated that the series would be set in a universe parallel to the x-men films where "the us government is in the early days of being aware that something called mutants exist but the public is not". he felt it was unlikely that characters would cross over between the show and films, but noted that this could change between then and the premiere of the series. in august, singer confirmed that legion had actually been designed to fit into the x-men film series universe, but also to stand alone, so "you wouldn't have to label" the relationship between the series and the films. he teased plans to have the series "relate to future x-men movies". at new york comic con 2016, donner said that the series is "far from the x-men movies, but still "lives in that universe." the only way for x-men to keep moving forward is to be original and to surprise. and this is a surprise. it is very, very different." hawley explained that because the series is depicting the title character's "subjective reality", it would not have to address any connections to the films straight away, noting that fargo, which is connected to the 1996 film of the same name, at first "had to stand on its own feet" before exploring its explicit continuity connections more; "we have to earn the right to be part of this universe. my hope is we create something so strong that the people in the movie studio call and say they would be foolish enough not to connect these things." he did state that "you can't tell this story without" acknowledging that legion is the son of the same incarnation of charles xavier who appears in the films (portrayed by patrick stewart and james mcavoy).donner stated in january 2017 that having hawley focus on haller's perspective of reality rather than connections to the x-men films allowed the series to avoid the convoluted continuity of the films, "because we play with so many different timelines, and we rebooted and not really rebooted and all that" throughout the films. therefore, "the cinematic universe will not worry about legion." for the onscreen confirmation that xavier is haller's father in "chapter 7", with xavier's signature wheelchair shown in a brief flashback, the series' production was able to choose from any of the variant wheelchairs used throughout the film series. they settled on the version from x-men: apocalypse, with the prop used in that film being brought out of storage for the show. in march 2017, patrick stewart was approached about reprising his role as xavier from the film series in the series' third season, saying he was "absolutely 100%" willing to reprise the role; while having stewart return as a present-day xavier had been "seriously considered" by showrunner noah hawley, he elected the older character's presence to be unnecessary upon deciding to have the season revolve around time travel, and, after finding james mcavoy to be unavailable for filming, cast harry lloyd as a young xavier.


=== the gifted (2017–2019) ===

in july 2016, after a series based on the hellfire club, an x-men comic property, did not move forward at fox, the network made a put pilot commitment for a different x-men based series. the new pilot, written by matt nix, was for an action-adventure series based on ordinary parents discovering their children's mutant abilities. fox entertainment president david madden said that "developing a marvel property has been a top priority for the network—and we are so pleased with how matt nix has led us into this thrilling universe." the series is produced by 20th century fox television and marvel television, with 20th handling the physical production of the series, and nix executive producing alongside x-men film series producers bryan singer, lauren shuler donner, and simon kinberg, and marvel television executives jeph loeb and jim chory. nix pitched the series to executives as "running on empty with mutants". he created an elaborate presentation using prezi which included photos of preferred actors that he had altered to look like mutants, and graphics to explain how the series would fit in with the continuity of the x-men films. on may 9, fox ordered the show to series as the gifted. the pilot had been called "one of the hottest pilots of the [2017] broadcast development season" by commentators. the first season consists of 13 episodes. in august, len wiseman joined as a director and executive producer for the season. that october, nix said that he had planned "a couple of seasons, in broad strokes", and stated that he wanted "to be doing this show for a long time." noting a growing trend in shorter, self-contained television seasons, nix said that he wanted the show to feel more like a traditional, long-running story and so have each season end in a satisfying way that does not feel "close-ended".on january 4, 2018, the series was renewed for a 16-episode second season. described as being designed for "limited runs", fox had not been in a hurry to give the series an early renewal before then. on april 17, 2019, it was announced that the series had been cancelled by fox. in february 2017, jamie chung was cast as a younger incarnation of clarice fong, an original asian incarnation of the marvel comics character blink previously introduced in the 2014 x-men film x-men: days of future past, portrayed by fan bingbing. chung was then joined by stephen moyer, sean teale, natalie alyn lind, amy acker, percy hynes white, coby bell, and emma dumont as lorna dane / polaris, the daughter of the incarnation of magneto portrayed by ian mckellen and michael fassbender.


== timeline ==
the events of the films are separated into two "timelines"; the original timeline and the new timeline. the setting of logan was initially implied by hugh jackman to be set in an alternate timeline and not following the prequel films, before director james mangold stated that it was related; marvel later officially classified the film as a separate universe from the film series in the official handbook of the marvel universe a-z. within the marvel multiverse, the original timeline was officially designated as earth-10005, the events of deadpool 2 as earth-41633, the events of logan as earth-17315, while the new timeline, consisting of the prequel films, deadpool and the new mutants remains undesignated.

=== critical response ===
wesley morris of the boston globe praised the first three x-men films as "more than a cash-guzzling wham-bang hollywood franchise ... these three movies sport philosophy, ideas, a telethon-load of causes, and a highly elastic us-versus-them allegory". morris praised x-men: the last stand for "put[ting] the heroes of a mighty summer blockbuster in a rare mortal position. realism at this time of year? how unorthodox!" roger ebert gave the films mostly positive reviews but criticized them for the amount of mutants, stating "their powers are so various and ill-matched that it's hard to keep them all on the same canvas".the first two films were highly praised due to their cerebral tone. however, when director bryan singer left the series, many criticized his successor, brett ratner. colin colvert of the star tribune felt "singer's sensitivity to [the discrimination themes] made the first two x-men films surprisingly resonant and soulful for comic-based summer extravaganzas ... singer is adept at juggling large casts of three-dimensional characters, ratner makes shallow, unimaginative bang-ups." james berardinelli felt, "x-men: the last stand isn't as taut or satisfying as x-men 2, but it's better constructed and better paced than the original x-men. the differences in quality between the three are minor, however; despite the change in directors, there seems to be a single vision." david denby of the new yorker praised "the liquid beauty and the poetic fantasy of singer's work", but called ratner's film "a crude synthesizer of comedy and action tropes". singer's third film in the series, x-men: days of future past, was also well received. alonso duralde of the wrap felt that "singer keeps things moving along briskly enough that you can just go along with the ride of superhero stuff without getting bogged down". spider-man director sam raimi said he was a fan of the series, particularly singer's films. film historian kim newman also tonally compared batman begins to singer's films. logan was nominated for the academy award for best adapted screenplay.there was criticism of the large casts and the limited screen time available for all of them. richard george of ign reacted well to the depictions of wolverine, professor x, magneto, jean grey, storm, william stryker, mystique, beast and nightcrawler; however, george thought many of the younger x-men characters, such as rogue, iceman, pyro, angel and kitty pryde were "adjectiveless teenagers", and was disappointed by cyclops' characterization. he observed the filmmakers were "big fans of silent henchmen", due to the small roles of the various villainous mutants; such as lady deathstrike and psylocke. jesse schedeen of ign stated that the continuity of the films does not make sense with dead characters returning with zero or little explanation, different versions of the same character appearing across multiple films, and plot points that are conveniently ignored in later films. he also criticized 20th century fox for not mapping out the series from the beginning. in his review of dark phoenix, joe morgenstern of the wall street journal characterized the entire x-men film series as being a "notoriously erratic franchise".


=== legacy ===
richard george of ign stated that the success of the first x-men film paved the way for comic-book film adaptations such as the spider-man series, fantastic four (2005), v for vendetta and singer's superman returns. chris hewitt of empire magazine called the first x-men film as the "catalyst" for films based on marvel comics characters, stating "singer's 2000 film is the catalyst for everything that's come since, good and bad. without it, there's no marvel studios." comic-book writer mark millar said that singer's x-men "revolutionized" superhero films.rebecca rubin of variety magazine stated that the x-men franchise has proven there is an audience for a hardline superhero film, while jeff bock of exhibitor relations said that with films like the deadpool films and logan, the studios can do more with an r-rated film and give the audience something new. however, tim grierson and will leitch of new york magazine's vulture criticized the series, noting that the best films of the series failed to capture the zeitgeist the way marvel cinematic universe films did.
