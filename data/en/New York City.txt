== etymology ==

in 1664, new york was named in honor of the duke of york (later king james ii of england). james's elder brother, king charles ii, appointed the duke as proprietor of the former territory of new netherland, including the city of new amsterdam, when england seized it from dutch control.


== history ==


=== early history ===

in the pre-columbian era, the area of present-day new york city was inhabited by algonquians, including the lenape. their homeland, known as lenapehoking, included the present-day areas of staten island, manhattan, the bronx, the western portion of long island (including brooklyn and queens), and the lower hudson valley.the first documented visit into new york harbor by a european was in 1524 by italian giovanni da verrazzano, an explorer from florence in the service of the french crown. he claimed the area for france and named it nouvelle angoulême (new angoulême). a spanish expedition, led by the portuguese captain estêvão gomes sailing for emperor charles v, arrived in new york harbor in january 1525 and charted the mouth of the hudson river, which he named río de san antonio ('saint anthony's river').in 1609, the english explorer henry hudson rediscovered new york harbor while searching for the northwest passage to the orient for the dutch east india company. he proceeded to sail up what the dutch would name the north river (now the hudson river), named first by hudson as the mauritius after maurice, prince of orange. hudson's first mate described the harbor as "a very good harbour for all windes" and the river as "a mile broad" and "full of fish".hudson claimed the region for the dutch east india company. in 1614, the area between cape cod and delaware bay was claimed by the netherlands and called nieuw-nederland ('new netherland'). the first non–native american inhabitant of what would eventually become new york city was juan rodriguez, a merchant from santo domingo who arrived in manhattan during the winter of 1613–14, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the dutch colonists.


=== dutch rule ===

a permanent european presence near new york harbor was established in 1624, making new york the 12th-oldest continuously occupied european-established settlement in the continental united states, with the founding of a dutch fur trading settlement on governors island. in 1625, construction was started on a citadel and fort amsterdam, later called nieuw amsterdam (new amsterdam), on present-day manhattan island.the colony of new amsterdam was centered on what would ultimately become lower manhattan. its area extended from the southern tip of manhattan to modern-day wall street, where a 12-foot (3.7 m) wooden stockade was built in 1653 to protect against native american and british raids. in 1626, the dutch colonial director-general peter minuit, acting as charged by the dutch west india company, purchased the island of manhattan from the canarsie, a small lenape band, for "the value of 60 guilders" (about $900 in 2018). a frequently told but disproved legend claims that manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.following the purchase, new amsterdam grew slowly. to attract settlers, the dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy dutchmen (patroons, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to new netherland would be awarded swaths of land, along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. this program had little success.since 1621, the dutch west india company had operated as a monopoly in new netherland, on authority granted by the dutch states general. in 1639–1640, in an effort to bolster economic growth, the dutch west india company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the dutch west indies).in 1647, peter stuyvesant began his tenure as the last director-general of new netherland. during his tenure, the population of new netherland grew from 2,000 to 8,000. stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order in the colony; however, he earned a reputation as a despotic leader. he instituted regulations on liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the dutch reformed church, and blocked other religious groups (including quakers, jews, and lutherans) from establishing houses of worship. the dutch west india company would eventually attempt to ease tensions between stuyvesant and residents of new amsterdam.


=== english rule ===

in 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, stuyvesant surrendered new amsterdam to english troops, led by colonel richard nicolls, without bloodshed. the terms of the surrender permitted dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom.in 1667, during negotiations leading to the treaty of breda after the second anglo-dutch war, the victorious dutch decided to keep the nascent plantation colony of what is now suriname on the northern south american coast, which they had gained from the english; and in return, the english kept new amsterdam. the fledgling settlement was promptly renamed "new york" after the duke of york (the future king james ii and vii). after the founding, the duke gave part of the colony to proprietors george carteret and john berkeley. fort orange, 150 miles (240 km) north on the hudson river, was renamed albany after james's scottish title.on august 24, 1673, during the third anglo-dutch war, anthony colve of the dutch navy seized new york from the english at the behest of cornelis evertsen the youngest and rechristened it "new orange" after william iii, the prince of orange. the dutch would soon return the island to england under the treaty of westminster of november 1674.several intertribal wars among the native americans and some epidemics brought on by contact with the europeans caused sizeable population losses for the lenape between the years 1660 and 1670. by 1700, the lenape population had diminished to 200. new york experienced several yellow fever epidemics in the 18th century, losing ten percent of its population in 1702 alone.in the early 18th century, new york grew in importance as a trading port while as a part of the colony of new york. it became a center of slavery, with 42% of households enslaving africans by 1730. most cases were that of domestic slavery; others were hired out to work at labor. slavery became integrally tied to new york's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banking and shipping industries trading with the american south. during construction in foley square in the 1990s, the african burying ground was discovered; the cemetery included 10,000 to 20,000 of graves of colonial-era africans, some enslaved and some free.the 1735 trial and acquittal in manhattan of john peter zenger, who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor william cosby, helped to establish freedom of the press in north america. in 1754, columbia university was founded under charter by king george ii as king's college in lower manhattan.


=== american revolution ===

the stamp act congress met in new york in october 1765, as the sons of liberty organization emerged in the city and skirmished over the next ten years with british troops stationed there. the battle of long island, the largest battle of the american revolutionary war, was fought in august 1776 within the modern-day borough of brooklyn.after the battle, in which the americans were defeated, the british made the city their military and political base of operations in north america. the city was a haven for loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the british lines for freedom newly promised by the crown. as many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the british occupation. when the british forces evacuated new york at the close of the war in 1783, they transported thousands of freedmen for resettlement in nova scotia, england, and the caribbean.the attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the conference house on staten island between american delegates, including benjamin franklin, and british general lord howe on september 11, 1776. shortly after the british occupation began, the great fire of new york occurred, a large conflagration on the west side of lower manhattan, which destroyed about a quarter of the buildings in the city, including trinity church.


=== post-revolutionary period and early 19th century ===

in 1785, the assembly of the congress of the confederation made new york city the national capital shortly after the war. new york was the last capital of the u.s. under the articles of confederation and the first capital under the constitution of the united states. as the u.s. capital, new york city hosted several events of national scope in 1789—the first president of the united states, george washington, was inaugurated; the first united states congress and the supreme court of the united states each assembled for the first time; and the united states bill of rights was drafted, all at federal hall on wall street.in 1790, for the first time, new york city, surpassed philadelphia as the nation's largest city. at the end of 1790, the national capital was moved to philadelphia.over the nineteenth century, new york city's population grew from 60,000 to 3.43 million. under new york state's abolition act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties. together with slaves freed by their masters after the revolutionary war and escaped slaves, a significant free-black population gradually developed in manhattan. under such influential united states founders as alexander hamilton and john jay, the new york manumission society worked for abolition and established the african free school to educate black children. it was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state, and free blacks struggled afterward with discrimination. new york interracial abolitionist activism continued; among its leaders were graduates of the african free school. new york city's population jumped from 123,706 in 1820 to 312,710 by 1840, 16,000 of whom were black.
in the 19th century, the city was transformed by both commercial and residential development relating to its status as a national and international trading center, as well as by european immigration, respectively. the city adopted the commissioners' plan of 1811, which expanded the city street grid to encompass almost all of manhattan. the 1825 completion of the erie canal through central new york connected the atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the north american interior via the hudson river and the great lakes. local politics became dominated by tammany hall, a political machine supported by irish and german immigrants.several prominent american literary figures lived in new york during the 1830s and 1840s, including william cullen bryant, washington irving, herman melville, rufus wilmot griswold, john keese, nathaniel parker willis, and edgar allan poe. public-minded members of the contemporaneous business elite lobbied for the establishment of central park, which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an american city. and one of the most filmed and visited locations in the world, with 40 million visitors in 2013.the great irish famine brought a large influx of irish immigrants, of whom more than 200,000 were living in new york by 1860, representing upward of one-quarter of the city's population. there was also extensive immigration from the german provinces, where revolutions had disrupted societies, and germans comprised another 25% of new york's population by 1860.


=== american civil war ===

democratic party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the south and its dominant party. in 1861, mayor fernando wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from albany and the united states after the south seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. anger at new military conscription laws during the american civil war (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to hire a substitute, led to the draft riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic irish working class.the draft riots deteriorated into attacks on new york's elite, followed by attacks on black new yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between irish immigrants and black people for work. rioters burned the colored orphan asylum to the ground, with more than 200 children escaping harm due to efforts of the new york police department, which was mainly made up of irish immigrants.at least 120 people were killed. eleven black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of blacks to flee. the black population in manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865. the white working class had established dominance. violence by longshoremen against black men was especially fierce in the docks area. it was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in american history.


=== early 20th century ===

in 1898, the city of new york was formed with the consolidation of brooklyn (until then a separate city), the county of new york (which then included parts of the bronx), the county of richmond, and the western portion of the county of queens. the opening of the subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the new city together. throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication.in 1904, the steamship general slocum caught fire in the east river, killing 1,021 people on board. in 1911, the triangle shirtwaist factory fire, the city's worst industrial disaster, killed 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the international ladies' garment workers' union and major improvements in factory safety standards.
new york's non-white population was 36,620 in 1890. new york city was a prime destination in the early twentieth century for african americans during the great migration from the american south, and by 1916, new york city had become home to the largest urban african diaspora in north america. the harlem renaissance of literary and cultural life flourished during the era of prohibition. the larger economic boom generated construction of skyscrapers competing in height and creating an identifiable skyline.
new york city became the most populous urbanized area in the world in the early 1920s, overtaking london. the metropolitan area surpassed the 10 million mark in the early 1930s, becoming the first megacity in human history. the great depression saw the election of reformer fiorello la guardia as mayor and the fall of tammany hall after eighty years of political dominance.returning world war ii veterans created a post-war economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern queens and nassau county. new york emerged from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world, with wall street leading america's place as the world's dominant economic power. the united nations headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying new york's global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated new york's displacement of paris as the center of the art world.


=== late 20th and 21st centuries ===

in the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused new york city to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates. while a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city's economic health in the 1980s, new york's crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s. by the mid 1990s, crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both american transplants and new immigrants from asia and latin america.
new york city's population reached all-time highs in the 2000, 2010, and 2020 us censuses. important new sectors, such as silicon alley, emerged in the city's economy.
the advent of y2k was celebrated with fanfare in times square. new york city suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the september 11, 2001, attacks. two of the four airliners hijacked that day were flown into the twin towers of the world trade center, destroying the towers and killing 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers. the north tower became, and remains, the tallest building to ever be destroyed.the area was rebuilt with a new world trade center, the national september 11 memorial and museum, and other new buildings and infrastructure, including the world trade center transportation hub, the city's third-largest hub. the new one world trade center is the tallest skyscraper in the western hemisphere and the seventh-tallest building in the world by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet (541.3 m) in reference to the year of u.s. independence.the occupy wall street protests in zuccotti park in the financial district of lower manhattan began on september 17, 2011, receiving global attention and popularizing the occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide.new york city was heavily affected by hurricane sandy in late october 2012. sandy's impacts included the flooding of the new york city subway system, of many suburban communities, and of all road tunnels entering manhattan except the lincoln tunnel. the new york stock exchange closed for two consecutive days. at least 43 people died in new york city as a result of sandy, and the economic losses in new york city were estimated to be roughly $19 billion. the disaster spawned long-term efforts towards infrastructural projects to counter climate change and rising seas.in march 2020, the first case of covid-19 in the city was confirmed in manhattan. the city rapidly replaced wuhan, china to become the global epicenter of the pandemic during the early phase, before the infection became widespread across the world and the rest of the nation. as of march 2021, new york city had recorded over 30,000 deaths from covid-19-related complications.


== geography ==

new york city is situated in the northeastern united states, in southeastern new york state, approximately halfway between washington, d.c. and boston. its location at the mouth of the hudson river, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the atlantic ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. most of the city is built on the three islands of long island, manhattan, and staten island.
during the wisconsin glaciation, 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, the new york city area was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet. the erosive forward movement of the ice (and its subsequent retreat) contributed to the separation of what is now long island and staten island. that action left bedrock at a relatively shallow depth, providing a solid foundation for most of manhattan's skyscrapers.the hudson river flows through the hudson valley into new york bay. between new york city and troy, new york, the river is an estuary. the hudson river separates the city from the u.s. state of new jersey. the east river—a tidal strait—flows from long island sound and separates the bronx and manhattan from long island. the harlem river, another tidal strait between the east and hudson rivers, separates most of manhattan from the bronx. the bronx river, which flows through the bronx and westchester county, is the only entirely freshwater river in the city.the city's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since dutch colonial times; reclamation is most prominent in lower manhattan, with developments such as battery park city in the 1970s and 1980s. some of the natural relief in topography has been evened out, especially in manhattan.the city's total area is 468.484 square miles (1,213.37 km2). 302.643 sq mi (783.84 km2) of the city is land and 165.841 sq mi (429.53 km2) of is water. the highest point in the city is todt hill on staten island, which, at 409.8 feet (124.9 m) above sea level, is the highest point on the eastern seaboard south of maine. the summit of the ridge is mostly covered in woodlands as part of the staten island greenbelt.


=== boroughs ===

new york city is sometimes referred to collectively as the five boroughs. each borough is coextensive with a respective county of new york state, making new york city one of the u.s. municipalities in multiple counties. 
manhattan (new york county) is the geographically smallest and most densely populated borough. it is home to central park and most of the city's skyscrapers, and is sometimes locally known as the city. manhattan's population density of 72,033 people per square mile (27,812/km2) in 2015 makes it the highest of any county in the united states and higher than the density of any individual american city. manhattan is the cultural, administrative, and financial center of new york city and contains the headquarters of many major multinational corporations, the united nations headquarters, wall street, and a number of important universities. the borough is often described as the financial and cultural center of the world.brooklyn (kings county), on the western tip of long island, is the city's most populous borough. brooklyn is known for its cultural, social, and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, distinct neighborhoods, and a distinctive architectural heritage. downtown brooklyn is the largest central core neighborhood in the outer boroughs. the borough has a long beachfront shoreline including coney island, established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the u.s. marine park and prospect park are the two largest parks in brooklyn. since 2010, brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship and high technology startup firms, and of postmodern art and design. brooklyn is also home to fort hamilton, the u.s. military's only active duty installation within new york city, aside from coast guard operations. the facility was established in 1825 on the site of a battery used during the american revolution, and it is one of america's longest serving military forts.queens (queens county), on long island north and east of brooklyn, is geographically the largest borough, the most ethnically diverse county in the united states, and the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. queens is the site of the citi field baseball stadium, home of the new york mets, and hosts the annual u.s. open tennis tournament at flushing meadows–corona park. additionally, two of the three busiest airports serving the new york metropolitan area, john f. kennedy international airport and laguardia airport, are in queens.
the bronx (bronx county) is both new york city's northernmost borough, and the only one that is mostly on the mainland. it is the location of yankee stadium, the baseball park of the new york yankees, and home to the largest cooperatively-owned housing complex in the united states, co-op city. it is home to the bronx zoo, the world's largest metropolitan zoo, which spans 265 acres (1.07 km2) and houses more than 6,000 animals. the bronx is the birthplace of hip hop music and its associated culture. pelham bay park is the largest park in new york city, at 2,772 acres (1,122 ha).staten island (richmond county) is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs. it is connected to brooklyn by the verrazzano-narrows bridge, and to manhattan by way of the free staten island ferry. in central staten island, the staten island greenbelt spans approximately 2,500 acres (10 km2), including 28 miles (45 km) of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city. designated in 1984 to protect the island's natural lands, the greenbelt comprises seven city parks.


=== climate ===

under the köppen climate classification, new york city has a humid subtropical climate (cfa), and is the northernmost major city on the north american continent with this categorization. the suburbs to the immediate north and west are in the transitional zone between humid subtropical and humid continental climates (dfa). annually, the city averages 234 days with at least some sunshine.winters are chilly and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow sea breezes offshore temper the moderating effects of the atlantic ocean; yet the atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the appalachian mountains keep the city warmer in the winter than inland north american cities at similar or lesser latitudes. the daily mean temperature in january, the area's coldest month, is 33.3 °f (0.7 °c). temperatures usually drop to 10 °f (−12 °c) several times per winter, yet can also reach 60 °f (16 °c) for several days even in the coldest winter month. spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from cool to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity. summers are typically hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 77.5 °f (25.3 °c) in july.nighttime temperatures are often enhanced due to the urban heat island effect. daytime temperatures exceed 90 °f (32 °c) on average of 17 days each summer and in some years exceed 100 °f (38 °c), although this is a rare achievement, last occurring on july 18, 2012. similarly, readings of 0 °f (−18 °c) are extremely rare, last occurring on february 14, 2016. extreme temperatures have ranged from 106 °f (41 °c), recorded on july 9, 1936, down to −15 °f (−26 °c) on february 9, 1934; the coldest recorded wind chill was −37 °f (−38 °c) on the same day as the all-time record low. the record cold daily maximum was 2 °f (−17 °c) on december 30, 1917, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum was 87 °f (31 °c), on july 2, 1903. the average water temperature of the nearby atlantic ocean ranges from 39.7 °f (4.3 °c) in february to 74.1 °f (23.4 °c) in august.the city receives 49.5 inches (1,260 mm) of precipitation annually, which is relatively evenly spread throughout the year. average winter snowfall between 1991 and 2020 was 29.8 inches (76 cm); this varies considerably between years. hurricanes and tropical storms are rare in the new york area. hurricane sandy brought a destructive storm surge to new york city on the evening of october 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels, and subway lines in lower manhattan and other areas of the city and cutting off electricity in many parts of the city and its suburbs. the storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the city and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.


=== parks ===

the city of new york has a complex park system, with various lands operated by the national park service, the new york state office of parks, recreation and historic preservation, and the new york city department of parks and recreation. in its 2018 parkscore ranking, the trust for public land reported that the park system in new york city was the ninth-best park system among the fifty most populous u.s. cities.gateway national recreation area contains over 26,000 acres (110 km2), most of it in new york city. in brooklyn and queens, the park contains over 9,000 acres (36 km2) of salt marsh, wetlands, islands, and water, including most of jamaica bay and the jamaica bay wildlife refuge. also in queens, the park includes a significant portion of the western rockaway peninsula, most notably jacob riis park and fort tilden. in staten island, it includes fort wadsworth, with historic pre-civil war era battery weed and fort tompkins, and great kills park.
the statue of liberty national monument and ellis island immigration museum are managed by the national park service and are in both new york and new jersey. they are joined in the harbor by governors island national monument. historic sites under federal management on manhattan island include stonewall national monument; castle clinton national monument; federal hall national memorial; theodore roosevelt birthplace national historic site; general grant national memorial (grant's tomb); african burial ground national monument; and hamilton grange national memorial. hundreds of properties are listed on the national register of historic places or as a national historic landmark.

== transportation ==


=== rapid transit ===
mass transit in new york city, most of which runs 24 hours a day, accounts for one in every three users of mass transit in the united states, and two-thirds of the nation's rail riders live in the new york city metropolitan area.


==== buses ====
new york city's public bus fleet runs 24/7 and is the largest in north america. the port authority bus terminal, the main intercity bus terminal of the city, serves 7,000 buses and 200,000 commuters daily, making it the busiest bus station in the world.


==== rail ====

the new york city subway system is the largest rapid transit system in the world when measured by stations in operation, with 472, and by length of routes. nearly all of new york's subway system is open 24 hours a day, in contrast to the overnight shutdown common to systems in most cities. the new york city subway is the busiest metropolitan rail transit system in the western hemisphere, with 1.70 billion passenger rides in 2019, while grand central terminal, referred to as "grand central station", is the world's largest railway station by number of train platforms.public transport is widely used in new york city. 54.6% of new yorkers commuted to work in 2005 using mass transit. this is in contrast to the rest of the united states, where 91% of commuters travel in automobiles to their workplace. according to the new york city comptroller, workers in the new york city area spend an average of 6 hours and 18 minutes getting to work each week, the longest commute time in the nation among large cities. new york is the only u.s. city in which a majority (52%) of households do not have a car; only 22% of manhattanites own a car. due to their high usage of mass transit, new yorkers spend less of their household income on transportation than the national average, saving $19 billion annually on transportation compared to other urban americans.new york city's commuter rail network is the largest in north america. the rail network, connecting new york city to its suburbs, consists of the long island rail road, metro-north railroad, and new jersey transit. the combined systems converge at grand central terminal and pennsylvania station and contain more than 250 stations and 20 rail lines. for 24 hours a day, the elevated airtrain system in queens connects jfk international airport to the new york city subway and the long island rail road; a separate airtrain system is planned alongside the grand central parkway to connect laguardia airport to these transit systems. for inter-city rail, new york city is served by amtrak, whose busiest station by a significant margin is new york penn station on the west side of manhattan, from which amtrak provides connections to boston, philadelphia, and washington, d.c. along the northeast corridor, and long-distance train service to other north american cities.the staten island railway rapid transit system solely serves staten island, operating 24 hours a day. the port authority trans-hudson (path train) links midtown and lower manhattan to northeastern new jersey. like the new york city subway, the path operates 24 hours a day; meaning three of the six rapid transit systems in the world which operate on 24-hour schedules are wholly or partly in new york (the others are a portion of the chicago "l", the patco speedline serving philadelphia, and the copenhagen metro).multibillion-dollar heavy rail transit projects under construction in new york city include the second avenue subway.


=== air ===

new york's airspace is the busiest in the united states and one of the world's busiest air transportation corridors. the three busiest airports in the new york metropolitan area include john f. kennedy international airport, newark liberty international airport, and laguardia airport; 130.5 million travelers used these three airports in 2016. jfk and newark liberty were the busiest and fourth busiest u.s. gateways for international air passengers, respectively, in 2012; as of 2011, jfk was the busiest airport for international passengers in north america.plans have advanced to expand passenger volume at a fourth airport, stewart international airport near newburgh, new york, by the port authority of new york and new jersey. plans were announced in july 2015 to entirely rebuild laguardia airport in a multibillion-dollar project to replace its aging facilities. other commercial airports in or serving the new york metropolitan area include long island macarthur airport, trenton–mercer airport and westchester county airport. the primary general aviation airport serving the area is teterboro airport.


=== ferries, taxis and trams ===

the staten island ferry is the world's busiest ferry route, carrying more than 23 million passengers from july 2015 through june 2016 on a 5.2-mile (8.4 km) route between staten island and lower manhattan and running 24/7. other ferry systems shuttle commuters between manhattan and other locales within the city and the metropolitan area. nyc ferry, a nycedc initiative with routes planned to travel to all five boroughs, was launched in 2017.other features of the city's transportation infrastructure encompass 13,587 yellow taxicabs; other vehicle for hire companies; and the roosevelt island tramway, an aerial tramway that transports commuters between roosevelt island and manhattan island.


=== cycling network ===

new york city has mixed cycling conditions that include urban density, relatively flat terrain, congested roadways with stop-and-go traffic, and many pedestrians. the city's large cycling population includes utility cyclists, such as delivery and messenger services; recreational cycling clubs; and an increasing number of commuters. cycling is increasingly popular in new york city; in 2017 there were approximately 450,000 daily bike trips, compared with 170,000 in 2005. as of 2017, new york city had 1,333 miles (2,145 km) of bike lanes, compared to 513 miles (826 km) in 2006. as of 2019, there are 126 miles (203 km) of segregated or "protected" bike lanes citywide.


=== streets and highways ===

 

streets are also a defining feature of the city. the commissioners' plan of 1811 greatly influenced its physical development. several streets and avenues, including broadway, wall street, madison avenue, and seventh avenue are used as metonyms for national industries: theater, finance, advertising, and fashion, respectively. new york city has an extensive web of freeways and parkways, which link the city's boroughs to each other and to north jersey, westchester county, long island, and southwestern connecticut through bridges and tunnels. because these highways serve millions of outer borough and suburban residents who commute into manhattan, it is common for motorists to be stranded for hours in traffic congestion that are a daily occurrence, particularly during rush hour. congestion pricing in new york city will go into effect in 2022 at the earliest. unlike the rest of the united states, new york state prohibits right or left turns on red in cities with a population greater than one million, to reduce traffic collisions and increase pedestrian safety. in new york city, therefore, all turns at red lights are illegal unless a sign permitting such maneuvers is present.
manhattan and staten island are primarily coterminous with islands of the same names, while queens and brooklyn are at the west end of the larger long island, and the bronx is on new york state's mainland. manhattan island is linked to new york city's outer boroughs and to new jersey by an extensive network of bridges and tunnels. the 14-lane george washington bridge, connecting manhattan to new jersey across the hudson river, is the world's busiest motor vehicle bridge. the verrazzano-narrows bridge, spanning the narrows between brooklyn and staten island, is the longest suspension bridge in the americas and one of the world's longest. the brooklyn bridge, with its stone neo-gothic suspension towers, is an icon of the city itself; opened in 1883, it was the first steel-wire suspension bridge and was the longest suspension bridge in the world until 1903. the queensboro bridge "was the longest cantilever span in north america" from 1909 to 1917. the manhattan bridge, opened in 1909, "is considered to be the forerunner of modern suspension bridges", and its design "served as the model for the major long-span suspension bridges" of the early 20th century. the throgs neck bridge and whitestone bridge connect queens and the bronx, while the triborough bridge connects the three boroughs of manhattan, queens, and the bronx.

the lincoln tunnel, which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the hudson river between new jersey and midtown manhattan, is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world. the tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed through new york harbor and up the hudson river to manhattan's piers. the holland tunnel, connecting lower manhattan to jersey city, new jersey, was the first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927. the queens–midtown tunnel, built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting manhattan with queens and brooklyn, was the largest non-federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940. the brooklyn–battery tunnel (officially known as the hugh l. carey tunnel) runs underneath battery park and connects the financial district in lower manhattan to red hook in brooklyn.

=== international relations ===

in 2006, the sister city program was restructured and renamed new york city global partners. through this program, new york city has expanded its international outreach to a network of cities worldwide. new york's historic sister cities are denoted below by the year they joined new york city's partnership network.
