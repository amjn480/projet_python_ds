== history ==


=== launch as a mail-based rental business (1997–2006) ===
netflix was founded by marc randolph and reed hastings on august 29, 1997, in scotts valley, california. hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, was a co-founder of pure software, which was acquired by rational software that year for $750 million, the then biggest acquisition in silicon valley history. randolph had worked as a marketing director for pure software after pure atria acquired a company where randolph worked. he was previously a co-founder of microwarehouse, a computer mail-order company as well as vice president of marketing for borland. hastings and randolph came up with the idea for netflix while carpooling between their homes in santa cruz, california, and pure atria's headquarters in sunnyvale. patty mccord, later head of human resources at netflix, was also in the carpool group. randolph admired amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the internet using a similar model. hastings and randolph considered and rejected selling and renting vhs as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. when they heard about dvds, first introduced in the united states in early 1998, they tested the concept of selling or renting dvds by mail by mailing a compact disc to hastings's house in santa cruz. when the disc arrived intact, they decided to enter the $16 billion home-video sales and rental industry. hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start netflix after being fined $40 at a blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of apollo 13. hastings invested $2.5 million into netflix from the sale of pure atria. netflix launched as the first dvd rental and sales website with 30 employees and 925 titles available—nearly all dvds published. randolph and hastings met with jeff bezos, where amazon offered to acquire netflix for between $14 and $16 million. fearing competition from amazon, randolph at first thought the offer was fair, but hastings, who owned 70% of the company, turned it down on the plane ride home.initially, netflix offered a per-rental model for each dvd but introduced a monthly subscription concept in september 1999. the per-rental model was dropped by early 2000, allowing the company to focus on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees. in september 2000, during the dot-com bubble, while netflix was suffering losses, hastings and randolph offered to sell the company to blockbuster for $50 million. john antioco, ceo of blockbuster, thought the offer was a joke and declined, saying, "the dot-com hysteria is completely overblown." while netflix experienced fast growth in early 2001, the continued effects of the dot-com bubble collapse and the september 11 attacks caused the company to hold off plans for its initial public offering (ipo) and to lay off one-third of its 120 employees.
dvd players were a popular gift for holiday sales in late 2001, and demand for dvd subscription services were "growing like crazy", according to chief talent officer patty mccord. the company went public on may 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at us$15.00 per share. in 2003, netflix was issued a patent by the u.s. patent & trademark office to cover its subscription rental service and several extensions. netflix posted its first profit in 2003, earning $6.5 million on revenues of $272 million; by 2004, profit had increased to $49 million on over $500 million in revenues. in 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and netflix shipped 1 million dvds out every day.in 2004, blockbuster introduced a dvd rental service, which not only allowed users to check out titles through online sites but allowed for them to return them at brick and-mortar stores. by 2006, blockbuster's service reached two million users, and while trailing netflix's subscriber count, was drawing business away from netflix. netflix lowered fees in 2007. while it was an urban legend that netflix ultimately "killed" blockbuster in the dvd rental market, blockbuster's debt load and internal disagreements hurt the company.on april 4, 2006, netflix filed a patent infringement lawsuit in which it demanded a jury trial in the united states district court for the northern district of california, alleging that blockbuster's online dvd rental subscription program violated two patents held by netflix. the first cause of action alleged blockbuster's infringement of copying the "dynamic queue" of dvds available for each customer, netflix's method of using the ranked preferences in the queue to send dvds to subscribers, and netflix's method permitting the queue to be updated and reordered. the second cause of action alleged infringement of the subscription rental service as well as netflix's methods of communication and delivery. the companies settled their dispute on june 25, 2007; terms were not disclosed.on october 1, 2006, netflix announced the netflix prize, $1,000,000 to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%. on september 21, 2009, it awarded the $1,000,000 prize to team "bellkor's pragmatic chaos." cinematch, launched in 2000, is a recommendation system that recommended movies to its users, many of which they might not ever had heard of before.through its division red envelope entertainment, netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as born into brothels and sherrybaby. in late 2006, red envelope entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as john waters. netflix closed red envelope entertainment in 2008.


=== transition to streaming services (2007–2012) ===
in january 2007, the company launched a streaming media service, introducing video on demand via the internet. however, at that time it only had 1,000 films available for streaming, compared to 70,000 available on dvd. the company had for some time considered offering movies online, but it was only in the mid-2000s that data speeds and bandwidth costs had improved sufficiently to allow customers to download movies from the net. the original idea was a "netflix box" that could download movies overnight, and be ready to watch the next day. by 2005, netflix had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service. but after witnessing how popular streaming services such as youtube were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept.in february 2007, netflix delivered its billionth dvd, a copy of babel to a customer in texas. in april 2007, netflix recruited replaytv founder anthony wood, to build a "netflix player" that would allow streaming content to be played directly on a television rather than a desktop or laptop. hastings eventually shut down the project to help encourage other hardware manufacturers to include built-in netflix support, which would be spun off as the digital media player product roku.in january 2008, all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost. this change came in a response to the introduction of hulu and to apple's new video-rental services. in august 2008, the netflix database was corrupted and the company was not able to ship dvds to customers for 3 days, leading the company to move all its data to the amazon web services cloud. in november 2008, netflix began offering subscribers rentals on blu-ray and discontinued its sale of used dvds. in 2009, netflix streams overtook dvd shipments.on january 6, 2010, netflix agreed with warner bros. to delay new release rentals to 28 days after the dvds

breaking bad, produced by sony pictures television, after the show's third season, at a point where original broadcaster amc had expressed the possibility of cancelling the show. sony pushed netflix to release breaking bad in time for the fourth season, which as a result, greatly expanded the show's audience on amc due to new viewers binging on the netflix past episodes, and doubling the viewership by the time of the fifth season. breaking bad is considered the first such show to have this "netflix effect."in january 2011, netflix announced agreements with several manufacturers to include branded netflix buttons on the remote controls of devices compatible with the service, such as blu-ray players. by may 2011, netflix had become the largest source of internet streaming traffic
